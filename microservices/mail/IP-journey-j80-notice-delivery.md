# IP-journey-j80-notice-delivery - mail

## Goal

Implement the `notice-delivery` slice for `mail` so j80 can satisfy `KR-PIPA + KR-CSAP` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/mail/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j80-kr-pipa-personal-info-cross-border-transfer/.
- Regulator article focus: KR-PIPA Art 23 sensitive information.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/mail/contracts/openapi/j80-notice-delivery-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/mail/contracts/asyncapi/j80-notice-delivery-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/mail/contracts/proto/j80-notice-delivery-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/mail/policy/j80-notice-delivery.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/mail/runbooks/j80-notice-delivery-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/mail/tests/j80_notice_delivery_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `kr-pipa-research-transfer` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j80.mail.notice-delivery", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "KR-PIPA + KR-CSAP" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "KR" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J80MailNoticeDeliveryStarted`.
- `J80MailNoticeDeliveryPermitted`.
- `J80MailNoticeDeliveryDenied`.
- `J80MailNoticeDeliveryCommitted`.
- `J80MailNoticeDeliveryRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - mail notice-delivery
Scope: implement one mail behavior for j80, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: KR-PIPA Art 23 sensitive information.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 5 healthcare urgent care + EHR break-glass.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.

Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

### IP row 023 - mail notice-delivery
Scope: implement one mail behavior for j80, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: KR-PIPA Art 34 breach notification.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 18 audit / regulator access.
Contract: AsyncAPI 3.1.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.

### IP row 024 - mail notice-delivery
Scope: implement one mail behavior for j80, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: Medical Service Act record boundary.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 23 cross-jurisdiction conflict.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)
- Carrier: public boundary uses `Oyatie-Version: 2026-05-21`, URL prefix `/v/2026-05-21/`, and proto3 field tag `8001` for `oyatie_version`.
- `declared_version`: `2026-05-21`; support window is `N=3` public date versions for at least `180` days after deprecation.
- Internal-mesh exemption: internal gRPC remains on mesh proto3 compatibility and does not require the public URL/header carrier.
- Surface evidence: `microservices/mail/IP-journey-j80-notice-delivery.md` matched `openapi, asyncapi, .proto`; contract files `microservices/mail/contracts/openapi/mail.yaml, microservices/mail/contracts/asyncapi/mail-events.yaml, microservices/mail/contracts/proto/mail.proto`; type anchor `crates/oya-shared-email-comms-kernel/src/lib.rs::OutboundMessage`.
