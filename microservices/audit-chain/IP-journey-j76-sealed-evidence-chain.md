# IP-journey-j76-sealed-evidence-chain - audit-chain

## Goal

Implement the `sealed-evidence-chain` slice for `audit-chain` so j76 can satisfy `EU-GDPR-2018-baseline` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/audit-chain/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j76-eu-gdpr-dsar-full-cascade/.
- Regulator article focus: GDPR Art 12 transparent communication.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/openapi/j76-sealed-evidence-chain-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/asyncapi/j76-sealed-evidence-chain-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/proto/j76-sealed-evidence-chain-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/audit-chain/policy/j76-sealed-evidence-chain.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/audit-chain/runbooks/j76-sealed-evidence-chain-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/audit-chain/tests/j76_sealed_evidence_chain_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `gdpr-dsar-cascade` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j76.audit-chain.sealed-evidence-chain", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "EU-GDPR-2018-baseline" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "EU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J76AuditChainSealedEvidenceChainStarted`.
- `J76AuditChainSealedEvidenceChainPermitted`.
- `J76AuditChainSealedEvidenceChainDenied`.
- `J76AuditChainSealedEvidenceChainCommitted`.
- `J76AuditChainSealedEvidenceChainRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - audit-chain sealed-evidence-chain
Scope: implement one audit-chain behavior for j76, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: GDPR Art 12 transparent communication.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 13 non-native-language user.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.

Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

## Wave 15 counterpart evidence note

This IP is checked against `microservices/audit-chain/competitor-parity-matrix.md` and `microservices/audit-chain/feature-parity-matrix-2026-05-20.md`, not against line count. For the `j76 sealed evidence chain` slice, the relevant counterpart gap is AWS CloudTrail / Google Cloud Audit Logs / Microsoft Purview Audit parity for searchable immutable audit history, plus Oyatie's additional tenant-verifiable Merkle proof path. The GitHub-pinned root and key manifests from `policy/seal-integrity.md` SI-04 and SI-11 are the evidence channel this implementation must preserve; if the slice cannot publish or verify through that channel, it remains below the Wave 15 substance bar.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)

- Authority: ADR-0342.
- Contract evidence: `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/openapi/audit-chain.yaml`, `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/asyncapi/audit-events.yaml`, `microservices/audit-chain/contracts/proto/audit-chain.proto`.
- Carrier: `YYYY-MM-DD` value via `Oyatie-Version` header + `/v/<date>/` URL prefix + public proto3 `string oyatie_version = 8001`.
- Initial `declared_version`: `2026-05-21`.
- Support window: `N=3` public versions for at least `180` days after deprecation.
- Internal-mesh exemption: per ADR-0145, internal gRPC over HTTP/3 remains proto3 tag-compatible and does not carry public version routing.
