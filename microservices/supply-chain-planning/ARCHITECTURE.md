# Architecture: Supply Chain Planning

## A. Boundary
This service owns plan demand, supply networks, global ATP, production scheduling, replenishment, and transportation planning at tenant scale. It does not own adjacent ERP concerns, payment rails, tenant identity, policy engine, workflow runtime, or ontology storage.

## B. Layer Map
| ADR-0105 layer | Planned responsibility |
|---|---|
| api | public command/query DTOs and OpenAPI 3.2.0 contract binding |
| rest | HTTP transport and idempotency enforcement |
| application | orchestration of usecases and transactions |
| usecase | command handlers and read models |
| domain | business invariants and aggregate roots |
| kernel | pure value objects and deterministic calculations |
| adapter | source-system, database, and external-system adapters |
| worker | batch migration, reconciliation, and async workflow workers |
| governance | policy, compliance, scorecards, and evidence gates |

## C. Bounded Context Architecture
### demand-plan
- Aggregate root: demand_plan_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### supply-network-plan
- Aggregate root: supply_network_plan_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### available-to-promise
- Aggregate root: available_to_promise_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### replenishment-plan
- Aggregate root: replenishment_plan_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### transportation-plan
- Aggregate root: transportation_plan_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### planning-scenario
- Aggregate root: planning_scenario_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

## D. Integration Topology

- production-planning: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- warehouse: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- marketplace: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- global-trade: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- intelligence: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- analytics: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.

## E. Failure Modes

- Source-system import drift: dry-run evidence identifies row, table, transform, and rejection reason.
- Cross-tenant reference attempt: Cedar denies before domain command execution and emits refusal evidence.
- Duplicate command submission: idempotency key returns previous result and increments duplicate metric.
- Regional outage: writes queue in the tenant home cell and reads expose stale-region metadata.
- Audit-chain outage: critical state transitions pause; non-critical queries continue with degraded banner.

## F. Data Integrity

Commands own local transactions. Cross-service work uses workflow-engine sagas and compensating transitions. Financial, inventory, trade, quality, and compliance documents reverse through explicit domain events rather than row deletion.

## G. Contracts

- REST: OpenAPI 3.2.0.
- Events: AsyncAPI 3.1.0.
- Internal RPC: proto3.
- Naming: BNF v4.1.
- Layers: ADR-0105 13-layer enum.

## H. Wave-3-G Follow-Up
The anchor architecture reserves the boundary. Wave-3-G adds contracts, Cedar policies, runbooks, SLOs, dashboards, catalog records, IaC, threat model, DPIA, capacity model, cost budget, failure modes, and implementation plans.
