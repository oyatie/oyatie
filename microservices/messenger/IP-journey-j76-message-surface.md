# IP-journey-j76-message-surface - messenger

## Goal

Implement the `message-surface` slice for `messenger` so j76 can satisfy `EU-GDPR-2018-baseline` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/messenger/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j76-eu-gdpr-dsar-full-cascade/.
- Regulator article focus: GDPR Art 12 transparent communication.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/messenger/contracts/openapi/j76-message-surface-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/messenger/contracts/asyncapi/j76-message-surface-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/messenger/contracts/proto/j76-message-surface-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/messenger/policy/j76-message-surface.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/messenger/runbooks/j76-message-surface-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/messenger/tests/j76_message_surface_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `gdpr-dsar-cascade` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j76.messenger.message-surface", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "EU-GDPR-2018-baseline" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "EU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J76MessengerMessageSurfaceStarted`.
- `J76MessengerMessageSurfacePermitted`.
- `J76MessengerMessageSurfaceDenied`.
- `J76MessengerMessageSurfaceCommitted`.
- `J76MessengerMessageSurfaceRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - messenger message-surface
Scope: implement one messenger behavior for j76, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: GDPR Art 12 transparent communication.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 13 non-native-language user.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.

### IP row 023 - messenger message-surface
Scope: implement one messenger behavior for j76, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: GDPR Art 15 access.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 18 audit / regulator access.
Contract: AsyncAPI 3.1.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

### IP row 024 - messenger message-surface
Scope: implement one messenger behavior for j76, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: GDPR Art 17 erasure.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)

- Authority: ADR-0342.
- Contract evidence: `microservices/messenger/contracts/openapi/messenger.yaml`, `microservices/messenger/contracts/asyncapi/messenger-events.yaml`, `microservices/messenger/contracts/proto/messenger.proto`.
- Carrier: `YYYY-MM-DD` value via `Oyatie-Version` header + `/v/<date>/` URL prefix + public proto3 `string oyatie_version = 8001`.
- Initial `declared_version`: `2026-05-21`.
- Support window: `N=3` public versions for at least `180` days after deprecation.
- Internal-mesh exemption: per ADR-0145, internal gRPC over HTTP/3 remains proto3 tag-compatible and does not carry public version routing.
