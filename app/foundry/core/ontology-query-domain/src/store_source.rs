//! The durable projection as a graph source.
//!
//! This is the whole point of the traversal split: the same walk that
//! serves the in-memory index now serves the store the projector
//! actually fills, so a query answers from replayed truth rather than
//! from whatever a caller happened to load into memory.
//!
//! Two conversions live here and nowhere else. **Time:** the store
//! records `observed_at_epoch_ms` (the log's own unit) while the
//! traversal's freshness floor is in seconds, so edges are converted on
//! the way out — the floor comparison itself stays untouched in the
//! walk. **Failure:** a store read that fails becomes
//! `KnowledgeGraphQueryError::Source`, never an empty result; a
//! traversal that swallowed an outage would report a smaller graph as
//! though it were the whole truth.
