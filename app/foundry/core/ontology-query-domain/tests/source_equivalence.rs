//! Two sources, one law.
//!
//! The same graph is loaded into the in-memory index and into the
//! durable projection store, then every request shape is run through
//! both and the responses must be IDENTICAL. This is the test the
//! traversal split exists to make possible: because the walk is written
//! once, a difference here can only come from a source, never from two
//! implementations of the law quietly diverging.
//!
//! It is also the regression net for the merged law tests — consent,
//! freshness, direction, edge filters, caps and cursors all run against
//! the store-backed path here without being restated.
