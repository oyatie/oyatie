//! `store == fold(log)` proven against the DURABLE store, not a second
//! in-memory one.
//!
//! Everything upstream of this file compared an in-memory projection to
//! an in-memory projection: `write_through::the_store_equals_the_fold_of_the_log`
//! mirrors into a `MemoryProjectionStore`, and the query plane's
//! `source_equivalence` loads both of its graph sources from one. Both
//! are real laws, and neither of them touches SQLite — so the adapter
//! that actually holds the data was held only to the port's conformance
//! suite, which never sees a log or a fold at all.
//!
//! The gap that leaves is not academic. The read path now serves from
//! the durable store, so anything the adapter drops, reorders, or
//! rounds on its way to disk is served as the answer. This file folds a
//! log that contains objects, an edge, and a poison, rebuilds a real
//! SQLite database from it, and compares that database to the fold —
//! then drops the connection and compares again, because a projection
//! that is only correct while its process is alive is not durable.
