//! The catch-up law: a durable projection behind its log can be brought
//! to the log's head, and `applied_head` means what it says.
//!
//! These pin the part most easily got wrong: catch-up resumes INCLUSIVE
//! of the store's own head entry, so a store built from a DIFFERENT log
//! is refused rather than topped up to a head that lies. `catchup.rs`
//! states what that does and does not prove.
