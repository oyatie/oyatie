//! Derivation of port-shaped audit events from the spine's own facts:
//! the action log's applied and poisoned entries and the denial trail
//! each become [`FoundryAuditEvent`]s for the foundry audit port.
//!
//! Derivation is pure over (projection, log entries) — recomputable at
//! any moment, like every other view — and honest: each consumed entry
//! lands in exactly one of (events, underivable), never on the floor. An
//! entry whose payload decodes as neither wire shape has no attribution,
//! and the port's fail-closed construction is the law, so the typed
//! [`Underivable`] channel is forced, not optional.
