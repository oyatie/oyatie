//! The denial trail: refused submissions become durable
//! [`DenialRecord`]s on a SEPARATE audit log instance — denials never
//! consume a tenant object ordinal and never forge an object ref.
//!
//! The idempotency key derives from the denial's own canonical bytes
//! (no clocks, no minted ids), so the identical refusal retried
//! deduplicates while divergent denials never conflict. An audit-append
//! failure is deliberately swallowed: the refusal returned to the
//! caller is the truth that must survive.
