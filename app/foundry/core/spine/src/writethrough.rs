//! Write-through: fold the log and mirror each outcome into the durable
//! projection store, so the store IS `fold(log)` rather than a second,
//! independently-maintained copy of it.
//!
//! Two laws shape this module.
//!
//! **A store failure is not a poison.** A poison is derived purely from
//! (log bytes, registry snapshot) and is therefore identical on every
//! replay; a store outage is infrastructure and is not. Recording one as
//! a poison would bake a transient failure into the projection forever.
//! So the runner HALTS on a store refusal, naming the ordinal it stopped
//! at, and the log remains the source of truth.
//!
//! **The in-memory state is disposable.** When the runner halts, the
//! fold has already consumed the entry the store refused, so `state` may
//! be one entry ahead of the store. That is safe precisely because
//! `ProjectionState` is rebuildable at any moment: a caller recovers by
//! refolding from the store's `applied_head`. What must never happen —
//! and what the suite pins — is the store holding a PARTIAL entry or a
//! fabricated poison.
