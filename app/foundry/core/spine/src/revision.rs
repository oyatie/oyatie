//! Reader pinning: one pure view over the projection and the kernel's
//! retained revision history. Behind the pin the view filters down to the
//! pinned vocabulary — lossless under additive-only evolution, and the
//! per-object deprecation window D80 names. Ahead of the pin the view shows
//! honest absence: a value the log never carried is never synthesized at
//! read. Refusals are typed; a read never touches the poison ledger. With
//! a matching plan, [`UpcastState`] is refined by the SAME predicate the
//! runner scans with; without one, written-below-pin is pending.
