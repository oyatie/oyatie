//! Catch-up: bring a durable projection to its log's head by refolding
//! from the store's own `applied_head`.
//!
//! [`crate::project_through`] has always DOCUMENTED this recovery — "a
//! caller recovers by refolding from the store's `applied_head`" — but
//! no caller existed. A store that halted on an outage, and a store
//! that was never populated at all, both had no way back, and
//! [`crate::store_sync_status`] could only report the lag it had no
//! means to close. That gap stopped being cosmetic when reads began
//! being served from the durable projection: a store younger than its
//! log answers incompletely, and answers with authority.
//!
//! **Catch-up resumes INCLUSIVE of the store's own head entry.**
//! Re-applying that entry is a deduplicated no-op when the store really
//! does hold this log, and a refusal when it does not. Without the
//! re-apply, catch-up would happily top up a store built from a
//! DIFFERENT log and leave it reporting `applied_head == log head`
//! while holding rows that are not `fold(log)` — a readiness signal
//! that lies.
//!
//! Revalidation alone proves only the resume POINT, and a head entry's
//! bytes can be identical under two logs that disagree earlier — one
//! envelope is one object, so a differing prefix need not reach it. So
//! catch-up also checks that **the poisons the store holds below its
//! head are the poisons this (log, registry) produces there**
//! ([`CatchUpError::DivergentPrefixPoisons`]). The prefix fold is
//! already computed to rebuild the resume state, so that costs one
//! store read and no extra folding.
//!
//! Neither check proves the whole prefix: a divergence that changes an
//! applied outcome without changing any poison still passes, and a
//! store whose file was swapped below its head can be exactly that. The
//! only full audit is a rebuild from empty. Closing it properly needs a
//! digest written at apply time — a port change, and its own lane.
//!
//! **Precondition: `registry` should be the snapshot the store was
//! built under.** The port deliberately holds no registry identity —
//! snapshots "live elsewhere" by its own scope clause — and proving a
//! resume runs against the SAME fold input is the [`crate::Checkpoint`]'s
//! job, which discards and refolds when the registry differs so that
//! "resume must never produce a state a fresh fold would not". This is
//! the durable twin of that operation and cannot make the comparison,
//! so it detects the evolution only where outcomes CHANGED: a
//! [`crate::PoisonReason::UnknownRevision`] that the evolution should
//! have un-poisoned now surfaces as `DivergentPrefixPoisons` rather
//! than silently persisting, and a changed head outcome surfaces as
//! [`CatchUpError::DivergentResumePoint`]. Both refusals have two
//! readings — a different log, or a different registry — and cannot
//! tell them apart. **After a registry evolution, rebuild from empty.**
//! That is not damage control: it IS the refold `UnknownRevision`
//! promises and the migration doctrine requires.
