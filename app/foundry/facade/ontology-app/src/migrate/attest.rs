//! `POST /v1/migrations/attest` — what a plan still owes.
//!
//! A READ of the projection dressed as a POST, because a plan does not fit in
//! a query string. Gated on `Use`, not `Invoke`, and it mutates nothing: the
//! attestation is pure and recomputable at any time.
//!
//! The plan is VALIDATED against the tenant's registry before it is attested,
//! by the same `MigrationPlan::validate` the runner calls and against the same
//! `registry_input` the runner admits from, so an attestation can never claim
//! a fixpoint over a plan the runner would refuse to execute.
