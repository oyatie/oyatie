//! Tenant isolation on the read plane, held by three independent walls.
//!
//! A caller bearing tenant B's credential must learn nothing about tenant
//! A — not the contents of an object, and not whether one exists. The
//! walls are: the credential binds the tenant server-side, so the request
//! cannot address another; the Cedar seed's structural forbid covers every
//! action, so even a permitted role is refused across tenants; and the
//! fold poisons a cross-tenant envelope, so the projection could not serve
//! one even if the first two were bypassed.
//!
//! Operator procedure: a 403 here is the intended answer, not an outage.
//! If a cross-tenant read ever returned 404 instead, that would be a
//! REGRESSION worth escalating — a distinguishable "not found" tells the
//! caller the object is absent from a tenant they were never entitled to
//! ask about.
