//! The read surface: pinned object reads, per-object history, the
//! governance audit view, and the type registry.
//!
//! Every read is authorized by the read action, separately from the write
//! action — a read-only operator must be able to open what the shell
//! renders for them. Reads serve the in-memory fold; the durable indexed
//! store is a separate lane's evidence and nothing here claims it.
//!
//! Operator procedure: a pinned read that reports `UpcastPending` is not a
//! fault — the object was written under an earlier revision and the
//! migration that would carry it forward has not run for it yet. A
//! `409` on a pin means the revision was never accepted for that type.
