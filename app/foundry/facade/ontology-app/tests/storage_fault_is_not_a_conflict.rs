//! A storage fault is the SERVICE's failure, not the caller's.
//!
//! `WriteError::Log` carries two variants that mean opposite things.
//! `IdempotencyConflict` is the caller reusing a spent key on different
//! content: their mistake, 409, and retrying the same bytes will not help.
//! `Storage` is an adapter-level I/O or corruption fault: the service's
//! failure, and retrying may well succeed.
//!
//! Answering the second with the first tells a caller their write collided
//! with itself when the disk was the problem — a cause that did not occur,
//! blame in the wrong place, and advice against the retry that would work.
