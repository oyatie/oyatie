//! The counters report what the process actually did.
//!
//! Asserting that `/metrics` *mentions* a counter proves nothing: the
//! exposition emits a `# HELP` and `# TYPE` line for every declared metric
//! whether or not anything ever increments it. That is how a metric declared
//! and never sampled survived a suite that claimed to check it. These tests
//! drive the real router and assert exact VALUE lines, so a counter that
//! never counts fails here.
//!
//! Operator procedure: these values are process-lifetime and unlabelled by
//! tenant. `/metrics` is unauthenticated by design, so it must not become a
//! tenancy oracle — that is why an objective over them is a scrape-level
//! statement and not a per-tenant one.
