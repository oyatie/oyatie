//! Policy version diff — deterministic impact classification between two `PolicyVersion`s.
//!
//! `diff_policy_versions(prev, next)` compares every rule in `prev` against every rule
//! in `next` and classifies each change as one of the [`RuleDelta`] variants.
//! [`ImpactReport::has_widening`] signals whether the change broadens the allow surface
//! or removes a deny guard, enabling pre-publish security gates.
//!
//! Pure value transform: no I/O, no clock, no new dependencies beyond `serde`.
