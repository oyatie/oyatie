//! Stratification: refusing a model whose negation is self-referential.
//!
//! Returning "not a member" when a relation re-enters itself is a
//! least-fixed-point convention, and it is sound only while every operator is
//! monotone — adding a tuple may add grants, never remove one. `Difference` is
//! not monotone. If a relation reaches itself through the SUBTRACTED side, the
//! re-entry reads as "not excluded" and the check grants:
//!
//! ```text
//! doc#editor = Difference(This, ComputedUserset(banned))
//! doc#banned = ComputedUserset(editor)
//! doc:spec#editor@user:alice   ->   editor(alice) = ALLOW
//! ```
//!
//! The author wrote a rule that excludes the banned and got one that grants
//! them. Deciding it at check time would be a wrong allow; deciding it here
//! makes the model unbuildable instead.
