//! The arithmetic of the negation marks, one property per mutation it admits.
//!
//! `crosses_negation` asks whether a re-entered node sits BELOW the innermost
//! enclosing subtraction. Three numbers decide that: where a mark is recorded,
//! whether the comparison is strict, and which mark is consulted. Every test
//! in `negation_in_data.rs` passes with all three perturbed — they pin only
//! that the guard exists, not that it is placed correctly. Each test here
//! fails under exactly one such perturbation, and each asserts a value that
//! stratified semantics fixes independently of this implementation.
