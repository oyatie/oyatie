# build/ reorg drain notes (`integ/build`)

## Completed (this rail)

- W0-B Slice 1: six-crate skeleton under `build/port-engine/` (landed on `dev` via #1642).
- W0-B Slice 2: neutral seam types extracted to `port-engine-api`; kernel depends on api.
- W0-B Slice 3: `port-engine-source-pin` pin loader (package-local `src/upstream-pin.json` mirror);
  `port-engine-rust-ir` empty renderer stub; `port-engine-app` driver wiring.
- W0-B Slice 4: `port-engine-frontend-go` SourceModel snapshot decode + Go firewall architecture
  test (`Command::new("go")` / `std::process::Command` refused in library sources).
- W0-B Slice 5: `port-engine-rust-ir` syn/quote emit (`SynQuoteRenderer::render_rust_ir`) +
  leakage-forbidden fences (corpus needles + no host `Command` spawn); driver smoke wired.
- W0-B Slice 6: `port-engine-app` hand-rolled CLI (`help|ready|pin|emit-stub|emit-syn|verify-e2e`)
  + six-axis receipt e2e (`unchanged`/`explained`/`unexplained`/`incomplete`).
- W0-B Slice 7: `port-engine-hash` (sha2 → `sha256:<hex>`) + `port-engine-rulepack` (embedded
  neutral v0 mirror of forever `specs/port-rules/**`) + facade CLI (`digest|rulepack|plan`) and
  hashed receipt e2e. Forever specs tree remains integ/specs.
- W0-B Slice 8: `port-engine-snapshot` admits OOB bootstrap SourceModel fixture (pin + content
  digest verify; never spawns Go) + facade CLI `admit-snapshot` + e2e binds admitted digest.
- W0-B Slice 9: `port-engine-identity` (`engine_digest`) + `port-engine-toolchain` (dual-home
  corpus → `toolchain_digest`; cell remap still PARKED) + facade `pipeline|receipt|engine|toolchain`.
- W0-B Slice 10: fixture-gated `port-engine-rulepack` (object rules + ≥1 `selecting_fixtures` each;
  missing/omitted fixtures refuse load) — hermetic mirror only; forever tree still integ/specs.
- W0-B Slice 11: `port-engine-transform` applies plan constructions/preconditions → `RustIr`;
  facade `transform` + pipeline pin→admit→plan→transform→emit→receipt.
- W0-B Slice 12: receipt hardening — golden receipt, byte-identical re-run (`delta`/`verify`),
  `render` entrypoint; **no** bulk `k8s/` corpus emission (W0-B / out-of-envelope).
- W0-B Slice 13: `port-engine-emit` single-fixture canary seam — select one
  `__canary_empty_unit` region, golden compare, optional materialize under basename
  `port-engine-canary-out` only; facade `emit-canary`. Refuses `k8s/` / bulk emit.
- W0-B Slice 14: canary materialize round-trip (`materialize-canary`) + planted-defect
  detect (`canary-defect` → Red/Unexplained on canary region); still no bulk `k8s/`.
- Toolchains dual-home: `build/toolchains/**` byte-copies `toolchains/BUCK` +
  `toolchains/cache/{BUCK,OWNERS,defs.bzl}` (4 files). Live buck cell remains
  `toolchains = toolchains` in `.buckconfig` until remap+shrink. Slice 9 mirrors those bytes
  under `port-engine-toolchain/src/corpus/*.txt` for hermetic receipt binding (`.txt` so buck2
  srcs globs include them; logical dual-home paths stay in the digest preimage) — keep mirrors
  in sync when dual-home bytes change.

## Go translation lane (`port/engine-go-translation`)

Slices 1–14 built a translator that has never translated: `SourceModel` carries unit ids and
nothing else, so the whole emitted corpus is two empty functions. This lane makes the engine
port real Go. It is W1-shaped work — ADR-0637 D4 authorizes W0 only, and the W0-B ready gate
lists corpus work under `forbidden_until_open` — undertaken as an explicit operator override,
recorded here rather than implied.

- I1: hermetic Go corpus + stdlib-only bootstrap extractor under
  `port-engine-frontend-go/gosrc/` (out-of-band; nothing in the Rust build reads it). Emits
  snapshot envelope v1 with per-package declarations; digest over a length-prefixed
  arity-tagged preimage, not over JSON. Firewall extended: library sources may not NAME the
  corpus tree, not merely refrain from spawning `go`.
- I2: snapshot envelope v1 decoded in Rust. `SourceModel` gains `declarations`, carried as ONE
  uniform recursive node whose `kind` is a value — a const, a field, a param and a method are the
  same shape — so Go's taxonomy stays out of the neutral seam. Kind and flag vocabularies are
  CLOSED in the Go adapter (where naming Go is allowed) and refuse anything unknown.
  `snapshot_preimage_v1` extends the digest over the declaration tree, mirroring the extractor's
  encoder; the two agreeing over a real corpus is what `v1_fixture_admits_and_carries_declarations`
  proves. CLI: `declarations`.
- I3: the engine ports Go. `captures` is load-bearing and splits rules into unit-level (captures
  nothing — the unchanged canary path) and declaration-level (one region per captured
  declaration). Constructions `rust_const|rust_type_alias|rust_newtype|rust_struct|rust_trait|
  rust_fn` emit real Rust items; the type map and its per-construction overrides are pack DATA and
  an unmapped type refuses rather than guessing. Coverage is proven: a declaration no rule captures
  and no `deferred_kinds` entry accounts for REFUSES, so nothing is dropped in silence — and a
  deferral must carry a reason, which travels in the pack digest. The five decode-and-drop fields
  are closed out: `captures` drives selection, `precedence` must agree with declaration order,
  `conflict` accepts only the implemented policy, and `required_diagnostics`/`proof_obligations`
  refuse while unimplemented. The wire shape is `deny_unknown_fields`. CLI: `port-go`.
  Merged the plan's I4 into this increment: constructions cannot render without the type map.
- I5: two fences re-scoped. The emitted-bytes needle scan in `port-engine-rust-ir` is GONE — it
  refused output containing corpus identifiers, which is the program working, not leaking; the
  production-source neutrality test (the actual ADR-0637 D1 rule) stays and is what caught the
  first draft of the comment explaining the removal. "We emitted the target language" is now
  carried by `syn::parse_file` plus the compile proof rather than by six fixed strings.
  `port-engine-emit` gains `materialize_tree` under a SECOND allowlisted basename
  (`port-engine-emit-out`); the `k8s/`, `..` and basename refusals are unchanged, and a region id
  must be a bare identifier before it can name a file.
- I6: the compile proof. `tests/port_go_compiles.rs` feeds the assembled emit to `rustc` — the only
  check that distinguishes correct output from stable output, and the one that would have caught
  I3's `pub fn` in a trait and `const: String`, both of which syn accepted. Adds per-unit module
  assembly (grouped by transform-reported provenance, never by parsing sanitized region ids), a
  committed golden refreshable via `port-go-source > src/port-go-golden-v1.txt`, determinism over
  the real corpus, and a planted defect landing on `Unexplained`. The six receipt axes carry real
  values for the first time — the W0-B journal recorded that no axis had ever held one.
- I7: function bodies, opening the long tail. The extractor walks statements and expressions into
  the same uniform node shape, and resolves each identifier through `go/types` so a reference to a
  constant cases as a constant instead of naming nothing. The supported subset is small — return,
  if/else, single-name `:=`, literals, idents, parens, and the binary/unary operators with a direct
  target form. Everything else is RECORDED as an `unsupported` node naming the AST type, never
  dropped: a dropped construct makes an untranslatable function indistinguishable from an empty
  one. `rust_fn_body` is a separate construction from `rust_fn` so a pack asks for a body and gets
  a refusal if it cannot have one, rather than degrading to a stub that still compiles.
  `corpus-refused/` (a `for` and a `defer`) exercises the refusal against real Go — a translator
  whose refusals are only tested on hand-built inputs has not been shown to refuse anything a
  front end would produce.

## Still owed by this lane

- Struct methods still emit `todo!()`: bodies need selector expressions (`p.X` → `self.x`),
  composite literals, and call expressions. Those are the next subset, not a gap in I7.
- `specs/port-rules/lang/go-rust/**` remains unlanded; the pack is still the package-local mirror.
  Out of the `build/**` envelope, so it needs an integ/specs lane.
- Nothing emits into `k8s/`, and no Kubernetes corpus is admitted. That is W1 and is not this
  lane's to open.

## Next gaps (ordered)

1. **Lock absorb** — `Cargo.lock` / root `Cargo.toml` workspace membership refresh waits
   `#1646` land (ci/controller paths must exist before members); no third writer; libs `#1649`
   must not steal lock. Then refresh lock for path-dep / workspace edges (serde, syn, quote, sha2).
2. **Toolchains cell remap + shrink** — set `.buckconfig` `toolchains = build/toolchains`,
   update reachability/`toolchains/` prefixes (may need integ/specs attach), then delete
   root `toolchains/**`. Do not delete while the cell still points at the root path.
   **PARKED:** `.buckconfig` is outside `roots.build` envelope globs (`build/**` only).
   After remap, prefer digesting the live cell path and drop the package-local corpus mirror.
3. **Forever port-rules materializer** — land live `specs/port-rules/**` on integ/specs; replace
   package-local mirror with ADR-0597 materializer relationship (build tip keeps hermetic copy
   until then). Bootstrap Go extractor remains out-of-band only (Slice 8 admits artifacts only).
4. **Richer constructions** — expand beyond `pass_through` / `empty_canary` once forever
   `specs/port-rules/**` lands; keep kernel free of construction vocabulary.
5. **k8s/ materializer emit** — regenerable output into `k8s/` waits integ/k8s rail + ADR-0597
   materializer; W0-B forbids bulk corpus emission from integ/build.

## Out of envelope (do not touch from `integ/build`)

- `specs/k8s-port/` — judgment pending; no rehome (Slice 3 embeds a same-package mirror only).
- `specs/port-rules/**` — forever integ/specs (Slice 7 embeds hermetic mirror only).
- `k8s/**` — separate integ rail (mechanical port *generates into* k8s/; does not own the tree).
- `.buckconfig` cell remap for toolchains — coordinate with reachability/registry consumers.
- `ci/controller/**` members — wait `#1646` land (reverted premature absorb @ `72530017a`).
