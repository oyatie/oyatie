//! Proof that the kernel's compile-time neutrality rule (ADR-0637 D1) is capable of going RED.
//!
//! ## Why the enforcement is not here
//!
//! The enforcement is the `const` assertion block in `src/lib.rs`: the kernel reads its own bytes
//! with `include_str!` and refuses to COMPILE when a forbidden sequence is present. That is the
//! "build error, not lint" the admission plan requires, and it cannot be skipped, filtered, or
//! left unrun the way a test can.
//!
//! A const assertion cannot be demonstrated failing without breaking the build, so this file is
//! the demonstration: it drives the SAME predicates (`contains_token`, `contains_word`) over the
//! SAME needle sets (`FORBIDDEN_CORPUS_TOKENS`, `UNSCANNED_CODE_KEYWORDS`) that the build asserts
//! with. Sharing the predicate is deliberate — a test that reimplemented the search could stay
//! green while the enforced one was broken.
//!
//! The needles are safe to spell out HERE because nothing scans this file. That is also why they
//! live as bytes in the kernel: a needle written as text in the scanned file would be a needle in
//! the haystack.
//!
//! ## Coverage and its edges
//!
//! ENFORCED, at build time: the corpus vocabulary of the engine's first corpus, anywhere in the
//! kernel, in code or in prose. A quoting exemption would be a hole, so there is none. Plus the
//! two constructs that could hide code from the scan, which is what makes a one-file scan a
//! complete one.
//!
//! NOT ENFORCED: source/target LANGUAGE names. ADR-0637's language-neutrality amendment is filed
//! and not ratified, and a language-name scan is also unsound as written — the plausible slugs are
//! ordinary English substrings. The kernel carries language neutrality STRUCTURALLY instead
//! (`LanguagePair` is data, so a second pair is rule data rather than engine code) and its tests
//! use only invented slugs. Promote this to a scan when the amendment ratifies.
//!
//! ADR-0083 Tier-3: integration tests use unwrap/expect to assert invariants.
