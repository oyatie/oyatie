//! # port-engine-transform — plan → `RustIr` construction apply.
//!
//! ADR-0637 D1: the kernel plans; this core face applies rule **construction** / **precondition**
//! data (strings from the pack) into a deterministic [`RustIr`]. Unknown constructions refuse.
//!
//! Two rule shapes, told apart by DATA rather than by a flag:
//!
//! - A rule that captures nothing is **unit-level**: one region per unit. This is the shape the
//!   canary path uses, and it is unchanged.
//! - A rule that captures one or more declaration kinds is **declaration-level**: one region per
//!   captured declaration. This is the shape that actually ports Go.
//!
//! This crate owns the TARGET side of the translation — identifier casing and the shape of an
//! emitted item. What differs between language PAIRS reaches it as pack data. What the front end
//! and this face fixed between them — node kinds, attribute keys and their values, operator
//! spellings — is compared against literals here, some declared in `vocabulary` and some spelled
//! at the comparison; unlike the kernel, nothing scans this crate to keep any of it out.
