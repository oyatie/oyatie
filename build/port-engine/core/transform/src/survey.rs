//! What this engine can and cannot do with a source tree it has never seen.
//!
//! [`crate::apply`] is fail-closed: the first construct it cannot translate ends the run. That is
//! the right behaviour for PRODUCING a port — a partial port that compiles is worse than no port,
//! because nothing downstream can tell which half is real.
//!
//! It is the wrong behaviour for MEASURING one. Pointed at a real third-party package, `apply`
//! reports the first refusal and says nothing about the other nine hundred declarations, so the
//! engine's own maturity can only be discovered one construct at a time. A survey attempts every
//! declaration independently and reports all of it, which turns "what is missing" from a guess into
//! a ranked list.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately does NOT do, because both would make the number flattering:
//!
//! - it does not consult the pack's `applies` map. That map is policy — which units this programme
//!   has decided to port — and a survey asks a capability question instead: what COULD the engine
//!   do with this source. A survey restricted to units somebody already listed would measure the
//!   list.
//! - it does not count a refusal as a partial success. A declaration is translated or it is not,
//!   and the reason is carried verbatim so the ranking is by real cause rather than by category.
