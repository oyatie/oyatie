//! # port-engine-analysis — deciding ownership from observed facts.
//!
//! Go is garbage-collected, so a pointer carries no ownership information. The same `*T` may be a
//! borrow that does not outlive the call, an owned value passed by pointer for efficiency, or a
//! shared structure with live aliases; Rust needs the decision made, and it cannot be read off the
//! type. So the front end observes FACTS, the pack declares RULES, and this face pairs them.
//!
//! ## What this does not prove, stated first
//!
//! `docs/programs/k8s-port/census/ownership-escape.md` records the limit precisely: a `does not
//! escape` verdict proves LIFETIME compatibility and **not** the EXCLUSIVITY a Rust borrow needs.
//! Go callers may pass one pointer as two arguments, or retain an alias while the callee mutates
//! through another. That is a caller-side property, so no amount of callee analysis closes it.
//!
//! This face therefore produces a HYPOTHESIS, not a proof. What makes shipping a hypothesis
//! defensible is that the target language checks it: an emitted `&mut` the call sites cannot
//! satisfy is a borrow-check ERROR, caught by the compile proof, loud and located. The failure
//! mode of being wrong here is a red build, not silent corruption — which is exactly the trade the
//! `effect_unknown` fact exists to keep visible, since a disposition chosen on unproven facts is
//! marked as such in the record below rather than blending into the proven ones.
