//! Neutrality and toolchain fences for the target IR, scanned over the WHOLE crate.
//!
//! ## Why there is no scan of EMITTED bytes here
//!
//! There used to be. `render_rust_ir` refused any rendered output containing one of six fixed
//! strings — four corpus identifiers, plus the source language's package and function keywords.
//! It is gone, because it conflated two different claims:
//!
//! 1. The ENGINE must not know about the corpus. That is ADR-0637 D1, it is real, and it is what
//!    the scans below enforce over this crate's own sources.
//! 2. The engine's OUTPUT must not mention the corpus. That is not a rule anywhere and cannot be:
//!    the program exists to emit a Rust translation OF that corpus, so its output carries the
//!    corpus's identifiers in every doc comment, string literal and type name. A fence that
//!    reddens on the program succeeding is not a fence.
//!
//! The property the source-keyword needles reached for — "we emitted the target language, not the
//! source" — is now carried by something stronger than a substring list. The IR holds typed items,
//! `syn` parses the assembled tokens, and `rustc` compiles the result in the port-go compile
//! proof. Source-language text survives none of those steps, and it could easily have survived a
//! scan for six fixed strings.
