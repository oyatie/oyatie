//! Statements and expressions, with precedence decided by the TREE.
//!
//! The previous IR built bodies with `format!` and parenthesised every binary expression
//! unconditionally, because a text builder cannot see its own nesting and a wrong precedence
//! table produces arithmetic that compiles and computes something else. A tree can see it: a
//! child is parenthesised exactly when its own precedence binds looser than the position it sits
//! in, so `a + b * c` emits without parentheses and `(a + b) * c` keeps the one it needs.
//!
//! The precedence table itself lives in [`crate::ops`].
