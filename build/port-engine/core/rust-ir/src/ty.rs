//! Target types, as a tree.
//!
//! Today a type reaches the IR as a resolved target SPELLING — the rule pack's type map answers
//! with `i64`, `String`, `&'static str`, and the transform resolves a locally declared name to its
//! emitted identifier. So [`RustType::Path`] carries that spelling and the lowering parses it.
//!
//! That is deliberately a floor rather than a ceiling. The variants below exist so a structured
//! source type model can lower into a structured target type without this seam changing shape:
//! `[]T` becomes [`RustType::Generic`], `*T` becomes [`RustType::Reference`] or a `Box`, and a
//! multi-value result becomes [`RustType::Tuple`]. Until that phase lands, a pack that answers
//! with a spelling gets a `Path` and nothing pretends otherwise.
