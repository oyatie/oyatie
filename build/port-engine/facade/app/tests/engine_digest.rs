//! a sensitive function over a partial manifest reports a constant for every change to the part it
//! cannot see. The implementation this replaced had the second failure in its purest form — a
//! correct sha256 of a list of crate NAMES, which no engine change ever touched, so the kernel's
//! "changed bytes with no moved axis is RED" rule could not fire on the engine itself.
