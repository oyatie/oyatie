//! The compile proof: the Rust this engine emits for the hermetic Go corpus is fed to `rustc`.
//!
//! Every other check in this crate proves the pipeline is STABLE — the same input produces the
//! same bytes, the bytes match a golden, the six receipt axes agree. None of them proves the bytes
//! are CORRECT. A golden over broken output is a golden that pins the breakage in place, and the
//! I3 run produced exactly that shape of defect twice: `pub` on trait methods and
//! `const NAME: String`, both of which `syn` parsed happily and `rustc` rejects. Parsing is not
//! compiling, and only one of them is evidence.
//!
//! `rustc` is invoked directly rather than `cargo check`. The emitted crate has no dependencies,
//! so there is nothing for a manifest to resolve; going through cargo would add a package-cache
//! lock, a target directory, and a second build graph nested inside the one already running this
//! test, for no additional coverage.
//!
//! This spawns a subprocess, which the engine's own libraries may never do — the ADR-0638 D3
//! firewall is about the engine's LIBRARY sources and about the source-language toolchain. This is
//! a test binary invoking the target-language compiler, on the output, after the fact. It is the
//! opposite of the thing the firewall forbids: nothing here feeds back into what the engine emits.
