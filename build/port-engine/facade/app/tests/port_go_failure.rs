//! Not one construct but a CONVENTION, which is why it blocked every real package: the source
//! returns failure as an extra result that nothing requires a caller to check, and the target says
//! it in the return type, where the compiler does. These proofs are over the emitted crate rather
//! than over hand-built nodes, because a convention only exists across whole declarations.
