//! Facade driver wiring: composes the kernel entry points with the adapters.
//!
//! The facade is the only face allowed to depend on everything — composing the engine is its job.
//! Each module here is one composition: `smoke` proves a seam is inhabited, `pipeline` runs the
//! canary path, `port_go` runs the Go corpus, `report` carries what a run produced and how it can
//! refuse.
