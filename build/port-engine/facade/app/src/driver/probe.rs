//! Surveying source the engine has never seen.

//! Everything else in this driver ports the embedded fixture corpus, which is hermetic on purpose:
//! it is the same bytes every run, so a change in the output is a change in the engine. That makes
//! it the right thing to prove determinism against and the wrong thing to measure MATURITY against,
//! because a corpus written alongside the engine only ever contains what the engine already handles.
//!
//! This takes a snapshot from a path — a real package, extracted out of band — and reports what the
//! engine could and could not do with it. The report is a ranked work list rather than a score: the
//! useful output is which missing rule would unblock the most declarations.
