//! # port-engine-rulepack — fixture-gated neutral `RulePack` loader.
//!
//! ADR-0637 D1: rule SEMANTICS live in data under the forever home `specs/port-rules/**`. This
//! adapter embeds package-local mirrors and implements the `RulePack` and `PackSemantics` seams
//! from the ports face.
//!
//! **Every loaded rule MUST carry ≥1 positive selecting fixture**, and every fixture MUST agree
//! with the selection derived from `applies`. Missing, empty, or false fixtures cannot manufacture
//! coverage. Digest is SHA-256 of the embedded JSON bytes. Neutral only — no corpus vocabulary.
