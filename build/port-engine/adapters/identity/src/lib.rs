//! # port-engine-identity — the receipt's `engine_digest` axis.
//!
//! ADR-0637 D2 makes `engine_digest` one of six receipt axes, and the kernel's delta rule rests on
//! it: emitted bytes that change while every axis holds are `Unexplained` and RED, because nothing
//! accounts for them. That rule is only as good as what the axis actually covers.
//!
//! It used to cover a hand-maintained list of crate NAMES. An engine change moved nothing, so every
//! engine change was by the kernel's own definition an unexplained one — and nothing detected it,
//! because the delta check runs a single binary twice and can only answer `Unchanged`. The contract
//! was vacuous in the one direction where the engine is the thing changing.
//!
//! Now the axis is a content digest of the engine's own sources.
//!
//! **This crate owns the ENCODING, not the enumeration.** Which crates make up the engine is a
//! question only the facade can answer without inverting the dependency direction — an adapter
//! reaching into `core/` and `facade/` to read their sources would point the hexagon backwards, and
//! would also put files outside this package into this target's inputs, which no package-relative
//! build glob can express. So the facade passes the sources in and this decides what hashing them
//! means.
