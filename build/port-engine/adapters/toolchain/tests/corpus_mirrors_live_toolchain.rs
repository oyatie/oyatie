//! The toolchain receipt axis must notice its subject changed.
//!
//! `toolchain_digest` binds package-local `.txt` mirrors of `build/toolchains/**` rather than the
//! live files: the digest is a compile-time constant and `include_str!` outside the crate is not
//! visible to `rust_library`'s srcs glob. That embed is the only reason the receipt is hermetic --
//! and, unenforced, the only reason it can lie. The axis is documented as the toolchain IN FORCE,
//! so a mirror that stops equalling its live file makes an emitted-byte change caused by the
//! toolchain unattributable to any receipt axis.
//!
//! Nothing compared them until this fence, and `cache/OWNERS` had already drifted on `dev`.
