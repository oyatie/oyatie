/// field, add a method, change a parameter type, and `snapshot_digest` would not move. The
/// receipt would then find the emitted bytes changed with all six axes unchanged and classify a
/// perfectly well-explained change as `Unexplained` — or, worse, an emit that happened not to
/// change would be blessed as reproducible over a corpus that did.
///
/// The encoding is the same shape as v0's — decimal length prefixes with a `:` — extended with an
/// explicit child arity per node:
///
/// ```text
/// F(kind) F(name) F(type_ref) F(len(flags)) flags...
///     F(len(attrs)) (F(key) F(value))... F(len(children)) children...
/// ```
///
/// Length prefixes make each field unambiguous; the arity counts make the tree unambiguous. This
/// is mirrored byte-for-byte by the Go extractor's `encodeNode`. That duplication is deliberate:
/// the alternative is trusting the digest the extractor claims, which would let a front-end defect
/// enter the engine carrying a self-consistent receipt. Drift between the two implementations
/// surfaces here as [`AdmitError::DigestMismatch`].
