//! ADR-0638 D3 architecture fence: the Go firewall, scanned over the WHOLE crate.
//!
//! The fence used to read `include_str!("lib.rs")` and nothing else. That was complete only while
//! the crate was one file — a `mod other;` in lib.rs compiles `other.rs`, which the scan never
//! read, so the forbidden call had somewhere to hide one line below the thing checking for it.
//! `port-engine-kernel` closed the same hole by REFUSING `mod` at compile time; this crate cannot,
//! because it is modular by design.
//!
//! So the scanned set is enumerated, and then PROVEN to be the whole of `src/`. Enumeration alone
//! would rot the first time somebody adds a module and forgets this list; the completeness test is
//! what makes forgetting fail loudly instead of silently widening what may enter the crate.
