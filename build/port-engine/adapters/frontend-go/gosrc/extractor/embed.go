// Embedding, and the methods it PROMOTES.
//
// Go composes by embedding: an anonymous field or an embedded interface lifts the embedded type's
// methods into the outer type's method set, with no forwarding written anywhere. The target has no
// such rule, so what is implicit in the source has to become explicit in the emit — and what shape
// it takes depends on which side is embedding.
//
// An interface embedding an interface becomes a SUPERTRAIT. That is the census's own reading
// (`census/interfaces.md` §6: "Rust supertraits (`trait A: B`) map this directly"), and it is
// faithful: a type satisfying the outer interface satisfies the embedded one in both languages.
// 87.3% of embedding interfaces embed exactly one.
//
// A struct embedding a struct becomes FORWARDING METHODS. §11 item 7 records this as a gap the
// census could not close — its instrument recorded a method only from a declaration with a
// receiver, so 2,747 CORE struct types have method sets larger than it measured and 479 of them
// look like they have no methods at all. go/types closes it exactly, and this is where.

// interfaceEmbeds records the interfaces an interface embeds, for the target's supertrait list.
