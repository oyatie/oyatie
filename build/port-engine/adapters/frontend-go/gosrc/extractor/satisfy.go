// Interface satisfaction, observed at USE SITES.
//
// Go's interfaces are implicit: nothing in a type's declaration says which interfaces it satisfies,
// and structural matching is combinatorial. docs/programs/k8s-port/census/interfaces.md measured
// it — 80,042 name-level structural matches against 1,316 pairs the source declares outright, a
// ~60x gap — and its conclusion is that the engine must emit impls from USAGE.
//
// This is that pass. A pair is recorded where a concrete value actually flows into an
// interface-typed position: a declared assertion, an assignment, a call argument, a return. Each
// site is recorded with the pair, because a declared assertion is compile-checked by Go and a
// flow-derived one is this instrument's inference — a reviewer auditing an impl needs to know
// which kind it is looking at.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIND, so that the gap is a known one rather than a discovered one:
//   - a concrete value stored into an interface-typed struct FIELD, or into a map or slice of
//     interface, through a composite literal;
//   - satisfaction of an INLINE interface, which has no named trait to implement — that position
//     refuses at type resolution instead, so it is not lost, only refused elsewhere;
//   - anything in a package outside the corpus.
//
// The value/pointer distinction of Go's method set is deliberately NOT recorded. `var _ I = T{}`
// and `var _ I = (*T)(nil)` differ in Go because a value's method set excludes pointer-receiver
// methods; in the target the same distinction survives as borrow checking, and rustc enforces it
// on the emitted impl. Recording it would add a fact nothing reads.

// satisfaction is one observed pair: a concrete named type flowing into a named interface position.

	concrete *types.Named

	// HAS the interface's method set, so in the source it satisfies the interface everywhere,

	// written or the type does not have the interface at all.

// structuralSatisfactions pairs every concrete type this package declares with every interface this

//
// The source's interfaces are STRUCTURAL: a type with the method set has the interface, and no
// declaration says so anywhere. An engine that emitted an impl only where it saw the pair USED
// produces a crate that is strictly less capable than the source — a caller writing a generic
// function over the interface finds their own type rejected, which is the difference between a
// translation and an approximation. A reviewer reading the emitted crate found exactly that and
// called it the single most likely thing to bite a user of it.
//
// SCOPED to interfaces this package DECLARES, and that bound is the decision rather than a
// convenience. Those are the interfaces the package's own author designed, so an accidental match
// against one is that author's own design — and the target's coherence rule allows the impl,
// because the trait is emitted from this same unit. A structural match against an interface from
// somewhere else is a `foreign_satisfaction`, which has its own recorded answer.
