# cloud-network

`cloud-network` owns tenant-scoped VPC-equivalent networking, ingress/egress policy, mTLS enforcement, flow telemetry, and network isolation across Oyatie cells and deployment contexts.

This microservice follows the ADR-0330 `tenant_class` model:

- `demo_trial`: OCI Always Free default profile with explicit time and usage caps.
- `paid`: full production availability with composable `billing_components` (`revenue_share`, `per_seat`, `per_usage`).

Capability availability is no longer expressed through customer ladder labels. Product-quality differences must be modeled through `compliance_pack`, `cell_topology`, or context-specific capacity envelopes.
