# j09 - Integration test plan - Phishing-resistant account recovery

The plan proves the journey, not individual isolated functions. Tests are ordered from contract shape to full chaos replay.

## Test environments

| Environment | Purpose | Required packs |
|---|---|---|
| local-sim | schema, Cedar, and state-machine contract tests | baseline + journey pack |
| cell-pair | failover, partition, and replay tests | regulated cell plus DR pair |
| load-rig | 10x traffic and queue isolation tests | synthetic tenants |
| compliance-rig | regulator clock and report-shape tests | KR, EU, US overlays as applicable |

## Failure-mode tree

| Failure mode | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Network partition | The active cell records the command locally, emits a degraded audit event, and replays to sibling cells when the link returns. |
| Byzantine actor | Cedar default-deny refuses over-broad scope and audit-chain records the attempted escalation without leaking protected payloads. |
| Regional outage | Cell routing moves reads to the DR pair while writes use the journey-specific consistency policy. |
| Key compromise | OpenBao and SPIFFE attestation rotate the workload credential and quarantine only the affected principal or tenant. |
| Model or classifier error | The human-review or post-hoc review lane receives the evidence packet, while life-safety paths remain unblocked. |
| Replay or duplicate submit | Idempotency keys and audit-event hashes collapse duplicate operations into a single state transition. |

## Capacity and latency budget

Capacity model uses Little law: concurrent work in system equals arrival rate multiplied by service time.
For j09, the baseline planning rate is 100 journey starts per minute per active cell unless a stricter emergency or compliance pack overrides it.
The 10x surge model is 1000 starts per minute. At 250 ms median service time, expected concurrent active commands are 4.17; the shard plan reserves 64 partitions so one partition can fail hot without global collapse.
The 100x disaster drill is modeled separately as 10000 starts per minute. At 500 ms degraded service time, expected concurrent active commands are 83.4; the rate-limit floor never challenges emergency or safety traffic, but non-critical surfaces shed load first.

| Budget | Target | Evidence required |
|---|---:|---|
| Edge accept p95 | 250 ms | api-gateway trace histogram with tenant and cell dimensions |
| Cross-service command p95 | 800 ms | workflow-engine span tree with retry annotations |
| Audit seal p95 | 1000 ms | audit-chain seal latency histogram and Merkle proof sample |
| User notification p95 | 3000 ms | messenger or mail delivery metric split by provider |
| Regulator-clock start | 60 s | compliance event with jurisdiction pack and due-at timestamp |
