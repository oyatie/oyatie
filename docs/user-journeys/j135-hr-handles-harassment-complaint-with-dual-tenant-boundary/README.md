# j135 — Harassment complaint with dual-tenant boundary

## At a glance

Maya Olusegun (junior PM at marcus-tenant Austin) files a harassment complaint against her skip-level Daniel Reeves via Community's whistleblower-mode. Priya + Naomi investigate within strict per-ADR-0311 boundary: WORK Messenger is tenant-owned and lawfully readable for the investigation; PERSONAL Messenger of either party is NOT accessible. 3rd-party investigator (WorkRights Inc.) is engaged; investigation completes in 12 days; remedy implemented (Daniel transferred to IC role + PIP + training). Audit-chain receipts available for any future litigation.

## Why this journey matters

j135 is THE primary stress test of ADR-0311 dual-tenant boundary in an adversarial scenario. The platform must permit lawful HR investigation while refusing to pierce employee personal-tenant data even with HR-admin privileges. The investigation completes in 12 days (vs industry 60-90) because the platform's primitives compose: Community whistleblower-mode + Cedar permits + Workflow Engine + 3rd-party engagement + audit-chain Merkle seals.

## Personas

- **Maya Olusegun (complainant)** — junior PM, B2B_TENANT_MEMBER
- **Daniel Reeves (alleged perpetrator)** — senior EM, B2B_TENANT_MEMBER
- **Priya** — HR Director
- **Naomi Singh** — Legal counsel, B2B_LEGAL_ADMIN
- **Tamika Brooks** — WorkRights investigator, B2B_INVESTIGATOR
- **Marcus** — CEO; final-decision-maker on remedy
- **Sara Lim** — Austin HR manager

## µservices touched (7)

| µservice | Role in j135 |
|---|---|
| community | Whistleblower-mode complaint surface; pseudonymization layer |
| messenger | Work-Messenger investigation read (Cedar-permitted); pattern-search |
| identity | Perp pseudonymize + unpseudonymize; cross-tenant principal resolution |
| tenancy | 3rd-party engagement (WorkRights); investigation scope |
| audit-chain | 65 audit events sealed; final Merkle checkpoint |
| compliance | Per-jurisdiction overlay (Title VII, AGG, KR EEO, IN POSH); investigation pack |
| workflow-engine | Investigation workflow orchestration; interview scheduling |

## Key ADRs surfaced

- **ADR-0311 (load-bearing)** — Personal-Messenger of either party is NOT accessible to marcus-tenant during investigation. Cedar default-deny + explicit forbid clauses hold.
- **ADR-0244** — `B2B_INVESTIGATOR` + `B2B_LEGAL_ADMIN` audience-types
- **ADR-0263** — 15 audit-event classes
- **ADR-0312** — Court-warrant pierce path (only way to access personal-tenant data)
- **ADR-0292** — accessibility floor for sensitive surfaces

## Labor-law anchors

- US: Title VII Civil Rights Act §703; EEOC Enforcement Guidance 1999; Texas Labor Code Ch. 21; Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense
- EU: AGG (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz); Anti-Discrimination Directive 2000/78/EC Article 7
- KR: EEO Act Article 12-2
- IN: POSH 2013 (Sexual Harassment Prevention Act); requires ICC composition

## Artifact inventory

- `story.md` (≥800 lines)
- `ux-flow.md` (15 screens)
- `handshake.md` (7 phases)
- `schemas/whistleblower-complaint.json`
- `schemas/investigation.json`
- `schemas/investigation-finding.json`
- `schemas/audit-event-cascade.json`
- `schemas/cedar-permit-bundle.json`
- `integration-test-plan.md` (8 suites)
- Per-µservice IPs at `microservices/<svc>/IP-journey-j135-*.md` (7 files)

## How to use

- HR-platform engineers: read story.md ch1-ch3 + community + workflow-engine IPs
- Cedar policy engineers: read handshake.md + permit-bundle schema (this is the canonical boundary test)
- Security engineers: read integration-test-plan.md Suite 4 (personal-Messenger boundary)
- Compliance engineers: read compliance IP + per-jurisdiction overlay sections

## Cross-references

- Sibling HR journeys: j132 (mass hiring), j133 (layoff), j134 (staffing agency), j136 (benefits)
- Whistleblower lineage: j05 (anonymous ethics report — sibling pattern)
- Boundary stress test: j137-j141 (internal audit; sibling boundary tests)
- Court-warrant pierce: ADR-0312 + j129 (court-warrant pierces personal-tenant)
