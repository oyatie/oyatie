# j144 — UX flow (Workflow Studio job-search pipeline)

## Section A — Template selection (T+0 to T+5m)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A.1 | Workflow Studio canvas opens; "Set up your job-search pipeline?" widget visible | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.template.suggest` | `JobSearchTemplateSurfaced` | Unlocked by `B2C_JOB_SEEKER_ACTIVE` |
| A.2 | Template detail page: 7 blocks listed with descriptions + "What this does NOT do" disclaimer | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.template.preview` | `TemplatePreviewed` | Includes "No data leaves your tenant" notice |
| A.3 | "Use this template" CTA | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.template.instantiate` | `TemplateInstantiated` | Template forks to Chris's editable copy |

## Section B — Configuring blocks (T+5m to T+15m)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B.1 | Canvas with 7 blocks; Chris drags 4 onto active area | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.block.activate` | `BlockActivated × 4` | Sources, Filter, Drafter, Tracker |
| B.2 | Sources config drawer: checkboxes for 6 sources | connect | `b2c.connect.adapter.list` | `AdapterListViewed` | LinkedIn requires OAuth handshake (B.5) |
| B.3 | Filter config drawer: structured form for role, location, comp, exclusions | intelligence | `b2c.intelligence.filter_spec.author` | `FilterSpecAuthored` | Closed-form schema; not free-form |
| B.4 | Drafter config drawer: upload portfolio + résumé | intelligence | `b2c.intelligence.context.bind` | `IntelligenceContextBound` | Files indexed locally; no upload to 3rd-party |
| B.5 | LinkedIn OAuth handshake (Connect) | connect | `b2c.connect.oauth.initiate` | `OAuthInitiated`, `OAuthCompleted` | One-time; revocable |
| B.6 | Tracker config: create Notes database `Applications-2026` | notes | `b2c.notes.database.create` | `NotesDatabaseCreated` | 7-column schema |
| B.7 | Activate button | workflow-engine | `b2c.workflow_engine.template.deploy` | `JobSearchPipelineActivated` | Compiles canvas → engine template |

## Section C — Daily operation (T+15m to T+7d)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C.1 | Pipeline dashboard: live counters (raw_postings, filtered, drafts_ready, applied) | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_engine.run.observe` | `PipelineDashboardViewed` | Read-only; real-time |
| C.2 | Notes Applications-2026 view: each draft as a row with status badge | notes | `b2c.notes.database.read` | `NotesDatabaseViewed` | Sortable; filterable |
| C.3 | Click a draft → opens in Notes editor with the cover-letter draft inline | notes + intelligence | `b2c.notes.row.read` + `b2c.intelligence.draft.inspect` | `DraftInspected` | Annotation: model_id + prompt_template_hash visible |
| C.4 | Edit + mark `apply` → triggers submit-via-source-channel | workflow-engine + connect | `b2c.workflow_engine.action.submit_application` | `ApplicationSubmitted` | Routes through correct channel per source |
| C.5 | Retraining notice: "5 skip-marked applications used to retrain your filter" | intelligence | (informational) | `IntelligenceFilterRetrained` | Transparency floor |

## Section D — Anti-fraud (T+5d)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D.1 | Community Messenger: "Helen Park / Greenfield AI" message arrives with yellow scam banner | community + detection-substrate (HRRP) | `b2c.community.dm.receive` | `MessageReceived`, `EmploymentFraudPatternDetected` | High-risk-mode catch |
| D.2 | Tap "Report" → confirmation; pipeline filter auto-blacklists | community | `b2c.community.report.submit` | `EmploymentFraudReported`, `FilterBlacklistUpdated` | |
| D.3 | Real recruiter from KrampusCorp arrives later that day; clean badge | community | `b2c.community.dm.receive` | `MessageReceived{verified_recruiter=true}` | Verified employer tag |

## Section E — Interview scheduling (T+5d to T+7d)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E.1 | Workflow Studio prompts: "Activate Calendar + Mail blocks?" | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.block.suggest_activation` | `BlockSuggested` | Surfaces when first interview invite arrives |
| E.2 | Chris activates both blocks | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.block.activate` | `BlockActivated × 2` | |
| E.3 | Calendar finds available windows; ICS to KrampusCorp recruiter | calendar | `b2c.calendar.event.invite_emit` | `CalendarInviteEmitted` | Cross-tenant ICS round-trip |
| E.4 | Recruiter picks window; Calendar finalizes | calendar | `b2c.calendar.event.confirm` | `CalendarEventConfirmed` | |
| E.5 | Mail auto-reply sends thanks + calendar link | mail | `b2c.mail.auto_reply.send` | `AutoReplySent` | |

## Section F — Weekly digest (T+7d)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F.1 | Sunday 18:00 ET notification | workflow-engine | (scheduled) | `WeeklyDigestEmitted` | Push to Mail + Notes |
| F.2 | Open digest in Mail | mail | `b2c.mail.read` | `MailOpened` | |
| F.3 | Suggested actions sidebar with tappable items | workflow-studio | `b2c.workflow_studio.suggestion.read` | `SuggestionRead` | "Replace Otta?" → 1-click block-swap |

## Section G — Anti-leak invariants

1. Portfolio files indexed locally; no upload to external Intelligence service.
2. AI retraining stays on Chris's compute budget; no model weights leak out.
3. Cover-letter drafts MUST carry `intelligence_model_id` + `prompt_template_hash` (transparency floor; AEDT compliance).
4. Connect OAuth tokens MUST be revocable; revocation cuts source immediately.
5. Pipeline MUST gracefully degrade when one source breaks (rest continue).
6. The filter MUST NOT silently filter on protected characteristics (age, gender, race) — and indeed the structured filter schema has no such fields.

## Completion expansion — j144 ux rigor pass
