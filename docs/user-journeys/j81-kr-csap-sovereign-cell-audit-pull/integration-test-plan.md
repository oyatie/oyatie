# j81 - Integration test plan

## Test topology

- Journey object schema: `schemas/kr-csap-audit-pull.json`.
- Services under test: identity, tenancy, cell, cloud-iac, cloud-k8s, cloud-secrets, audit-chain, compliance, observability, ops-dashboard-control-center, governance.
- Contract versions: OpenAPI 3.2.0 external APIs, AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event channels, proto3 internal RPC.
- Policy engine: Cedar deny-wins, with explicit negative tests for missing tenant, stale pack receipt, wrong data class, and cross-border conflict.
- Audit: ADR-0263 events are asserted for start, commit, denial, rollback, and final receipt.
