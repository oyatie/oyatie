# j142 — UX flow (screen-by-screen)

The flow tracks Chris through the layoff conversation, the data-boundary moment, and the first 24 hours. Each row is one screen-state. Each row carries the µservice that owns the surface, the Cedar permit gating, and the audit-chain emission.

## Section A — The Meet call (work-tenant surface; T+0 to T+15m)

| # | Screen | Source µservice | Cedar permit | Audit emission | UX notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A.1 | Meet join screen, "Mary Zhang + Karim Jallow" preview | meet (work-tenant) | `b2b.meet.layoff_room.join` | `MeetRoomJoined{participant=chris,role=subject}` | Karim's tile carries a `HR Witness` badge (Cedar-rendered) |
| A.2 | In-call layout 3-up | meet | `b2b.meet.layoff_room.observe` | none | Chris's mic stays on his control |
| A.3 | Mary speaking (script) | meet (audio) | (same) | none | Captioning enabled by default for layoff calls (per accessibility floor) |
| A.4 | Karim screen-share of "What happens next" overview | meet (screenshare) | `b2b.meet.screenshare.share` (on Karim's side) | `ScreenSharePublished` | One-slide overview; reads "Personal tenant is yours; work tenant becomes read-only 30d" |
| A.5 | In-call notice "Your work-mail just received separation packet" | toast from mail µservice | none (Chris is recipient) | `MailDeliveredToInbox` | Discreet toast; Chris does not have to click |
| A.6 | In-call notice "Your work-mail will be read-only at end of call" | toast from workflow-engine | none (informational) | none | Calmly worded |
| A.7 | Meet ends; thank-you screen "Take what you need from work-Drive in 30d" | meet → workflow-engine | none | `MeetRoomLeft{role=subject}` | Karim has option to "follow up in 24h"; Chris can decline |

## Section B — The transition moment (cross-tenant; T+15m to T+30m)

| # | Screen | Source | Cedar permit | Audit | UX notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B.1 | Work-laptop home: dock now shows red dots on work-Mail, work-Drive, work-Messenger | identity (work-tenant) | `b2b.identity.session.revoked` | `SessionScopesRevoked{6_sessions}` | Visual: not punitive; just clear |
| B.2 | Work-Mail inbox loads in read-only mode, "Reply" button greyed | mail (work-tenant) | `b2b.mail.read_only_demoted` | `MailReadOnlyDemoted` | Banner: "You can read inbox for 30 days. Forward to personal if needed." |
| B.3 | Personal-phone notification: separation packet | mail (personal-tenant) | `b2c.mail.inbox.receive` | `MailDeliveredToPersonal{cross_tenant=true}` | Personal mail address received the cross-tenant packet |
| B.4 | Personal-phone notification: ERISA notice | mail (personal-tenant) | (same) | (same) | |
| B.5 | Personal-Messenger: Diego's message | messenger (personal-tenant) | `b2c.messenger.receive_dm` | `MessageReceived{from=diego}` | UX makes it clear: this is personal-tenant; the company cannot see this |
| B.6 | Personal-tenant identity audience_type updated (background) | identity (personal-tenant) | `b2c.identity.audience_type.update` | `AudienceTypeUpdated{from=B2C_CONSUMER,to=B2C_JOB_SEEKER_ACTIVE}` | No UI yet; surfaces in Section D |

## Section C — The afternoon (T+2h to T+8h)

| # | Screen | Source | Cedar | Audit | UX notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C.1 | Personal-Mail: open separation packet PDF | mail (personal) | `b2c.mail.attachment.open` | `MailAttachmentOpened` | PDF rendered in mail; no download forced |
| C.2 | COBRA election form (PDF interactive fields) | mail rendering | none (rendering local) | none | |
| C.3 | Click "Elect COBRA" → routes to adapter to vendor | connector | `b2c.connect.cobra_admin.submit` | `COBRAElectionSubmitted` | Confirmation screen "Premiums begin 2026-06-01" |
| C.4 | Back to Personal-Mail: open ERISA notice | mail (personal) | (same) | (same) | |
| C.5 | Click "Rollover to IRA" → trustee-to-trustee flow | connector | `b2c.connect.ira_provider.rollover_init` | `ERISARolloverInitiated` | "Funds arrive in 5 business days" |
| C.6 | Personal-Drive: 0 changes (verification surface) | drive (personal) | none | none | Chris just looks; UX shows no banner — it didn't change |
| C.7 | Work-Drive: read-only; "Export portfolio" CTA visible | drive (work-tenant) | `b2b.drive.export.preview` | `DriveExportPreviewed` | Sub-label "DLP scrub applies" |

## Section D — Evening: HRRP signal + high-risk mode (T+8h to T+12h)

| # | Screen | Source | Cedar | Audit | UX notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D.1 | Personal-phone: HRRP notification | identity (personal) → detection-substrate (ADR-0307) | `b2c.identity.protective_signal.surface` | `HRRPSignalSurfaced{reason=audience_type_change_to_job_seeker}` | "Scammers target newly-laid-off workers" |
| D.2 | Tap "Review high-risk-mode" → side-panel with toggles | identity (personal) | `b2c.identity.high_risk_mode.preview` | none | Three toggles: phishing, vishing, romance-scam |
| D.3 | Enable for 60 days; confirm | identity (personal) | `b2c.identity.high_risk_mode.enable` | `HighRiskModeEnabled{duration=60d}` | Confirmation "Active until 2026-07-26" |

## Section E — Thursday morning (T+24h)

| # | Screen | Source | Cedar | Audit | UX notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E.1 | Personal-laptop boots; personal-tenant shell loads | identity (personal) | `b2c.identity.login.passkey` | `LoginSuccess{passkey_credential_id=...}` | Same passkey that worked yesterday |
| E.2 | Personal-Workflow-Studio: new widget "Set up your job-search pipeline?" | workflow-studio (personal) | `b2c.workflow_studio.template.suggest` | `JobSearchTemplateSurfaced` | Template-suggest because of B2C_JOB_SEEKER_ACTIVE |
| E.3 | Personal-Community: nav now shows job-board + LinkedIn-mode + Handshake-mode entries | community (personal) | `b2c.community.job_seeker_mode.unlock` | `CommunityJobSeekerModeUnlocked` | New audience_type unlocks these tabs |
| E.4 | Personal-Mail: alumni-channel opt-in mail from former-employer's alumni-tenant | mail (personal) | `b2c.mail.alumni_invite.receive` | `AlumniInviteReceived` | Cross-tenant: from `<former-employer-tenant>.alumni` to Chris's personal mailbox |
| E.5 | Click opt-in → community moderation queue for alumni-channel | community (alumni-tenant; cross-tenant) | `b2c.community.alumni_channel.opt_in` | `AlumniChannelOptInRequested` | Approval handled by Karim per workflow |
| E.6 | Personal-Workflow-Studio: open job-search template (segue to j144) | workflow-studio (personal) | `b2c.workflow_studio.template.open` | `WorkflowTemplateOpened` | This screen hands off to j144 |

## Section F — Accessibility, internationalization, edge

### F.1 Accessibility floor

- Meet auto-captions on for layoff calls (per accessibility floor, applies to all "sensitive event" Meet contexts).
- Notification surface uses high-contrast color palette for layoff-related alerts.
- Screen-reader: all toast notifications carry `aria-live=polite` so they don't interrupt screen-reader narration.
- Tactile (mobile): single-vibration pattern for HRRP signals (not the urgent-vibration used for security alarms).

### F.2 Internationalization

- This story is US-Detroit centric. If Chris were in Seoul:
  - KR Employment Insurance Act (`고용보험법`) replaces COBRA logic
  - KR Labor Standards Act severance: 1 month/year tenure replaces 12-week US norm
  - Auto-reply text generated in Korean
  - The Workflow Engine pack-overlay swap is transparent
- If Chris were in Berlin:
  - EU European Works Council Directive notification triggers (collective layoffs ≥20/30d → works-council pre-consultation)
  - The Workflow Engine would have an extra 30-day works-council window before any termination
  - "Layoff Day Zero" would be Day-of-Notice, not Day-of-Effect — different UX

### F.3 Edge cases

- **Chris is on the call from his work laptop, on vacation.** Behavior: identical. Workflow-engine doesn't care about geography.
- **Chris is on parental leave.** Behavior: the workflow-engine has a `subject_on_protected_leave` gate that requires additional Cedar permits + jurisdictional compliance check (e.g., FMLA in US, German `Mutterschutzgesetz` in DE). Layoffs during protected leave are not impossible but require extra evidence.
- **Chris has open performance issues.** Behavior: the workflow-engine surfaces this in Priya's HR view (j133); Chris's UX is unchanged — the offboarding still proceeds with dignity.
- **Chris has a pending corporate-internal-audit hold** (Sam's investigation, see j137-j141). Behavior: the workflow-engine has a `subject_under_audit_hold` gate that pauses access-revocation pending audit-resolution; Chris would not see read-only-on-end-of-call; he would see "Access maintained pending audit; HR will contact you within 5 business days."
- **The work-tenant's billing is delinquent.** Behavior: the severance payable from the work-tenant's Payments account fails ACH; finops-portal escalates to Marcus; workflow-engine surfaces "severance payment retry; expect next batch" to Chris's personal mail.

## Section G — UX failure modes that should NOT happen

The following are documented as invariants to verify in integration-test-plan.md:

1. Chris must NEVER see his personal-tenant data fields populated in the work-tenant Meet client. (Anti-leak invariant.)
2. The "Reply" button on work-Mail MUST be greyed out at exactly T+0 (end of Meet call); not before, not after.
3. Chris's personal-Mail MUST receive the separation packet within 60 seconds of T+0; no longer.
4. The HRRP signal MUST NOT auto-enable high-risk-mode; it must require Chris's tap (consent floor).
5. The personal-Workflow-Studio template suggestion MUST NOT auto-execute; it must be Chris-initiated.
6. Cross-tenant Payments transfer MUST NOT proceed if Chris's personal-tenant identity is in a frozen state (per ADR-0300 §high-risk).
7. The work-tenant MUST NOT be able to send a Cedar permit that mutates Chris's personal-tenant Drive or personal-tenant Mail. (Cross-tenant write isolation per ADR-0145.)

## Section H — Hand-off to next journey

j142's terminal screen-state hands off to:
- j143 (when Chris clicks "Begin work-Drive export workflow" — could be later that week)
- j144 (when Chris opens the job-search template in personal-Workflow-Studio)
- j145 (when Chris first publishes a LinkedIn-mode profile in personal-Community)
- j147 (when Chris accepts the cohort invitation)
