# j90 - UX flow

## UX invariants

- The first viewport names the active tenant, jurisdiction, pack, and whether the user is acting personally, for work, as a delegate, or as an auditor.
- Sensitive flows avoid dark patterns. Consent is granular, refusal is available, and appeal is never hidden behind support copy.
- Minor, elder, healthcare, financial, and regulator-deadline paths honor documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 critical-path handling.
- Screens localize copy, date formats, deadline units, and regulator names without changing legal semantics.
