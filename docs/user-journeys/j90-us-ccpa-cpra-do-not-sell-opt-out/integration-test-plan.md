# j90 - Integration test plan

## Test topology

- Journey object schema: `schemas/ccpa-do-not-sell-cascade.json`.
- Services under test: identity, consent-graph, workflow-engine, community, social, shorts, intelligence, audit-chain, compliance, ontology, payments, plugin-app-store, tenancy.
- Contract versions: OpenAPI 3.2.0 external APIs, AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event channels, proto3 internal RPC.
- Policy engine: Cedar deny-wins, with explicit negative tests for missing tenant, stale pack receipt, wrong data class, and cross-border conflict.
- Audit: ADR-0263 events are asserted for start, commit, denial, rollback, and final receipt.

## Scenario matrix

### Test 026 - tenancy / appeal-path
Purpose: prove tenancy honors California Civil Code 1798.120 opt out of sale or sharing for `ccpa-do-not-sell-cascade`.
Setup: seed tenant, subject, pack receipt, Cedar policy bundle, idempotency key, deadline clock, and service fixture.
Action: submit the journey envelope through the same OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or proto3 path used in production.
Expected: PERMIT only when tenant_id, purpose, data_class, pack_id, and jurisdiction all align.
Negative assertion: DENY on missing pack receipt, conflicting jurisdiction, anonymous service path, or provider-BYOK/encryption-BYOK collapse.
Audit assertion: start, decision, mutation, and completion events are sealed and linked by prior_seal_ref.
Observability assertion: histogram and counter labels stay below the cardinality budget and contain no personal data.
Rollback assertion: injected failure returns state to pre-step value while preserving append-only audit history.
Evidence: test stores the correlation id, event class list, and schema validation result in the journey evidence bundle.
