# j108-supplier-rating-and-marketplace-discovery - Integration test plan

Purpose: prove that KrampusCorp rates AcmeRawMaterials, the rating feeds marketplace ranking, and other buyers discover
vendors through rating-weighted trust signals.

## Test environment

- Test tenants: tenant-krampuscorp-seoul, tenant-acme-rawmaterials-hamburg, tenant-boutiqueretailer-saopaulo.
- Test clock: deterministic HLC with per-region skew injection.
- Test policy: Cedar default-deny loaded first; permits are published after signature verification and soak.
- Test data: synthetic, non-production, no secrets, no live rails.
- Test contracts: OpenAPI 3.2.0, AsyncAPI 3.1.0, proto3, JSON Schema 2020-12.
