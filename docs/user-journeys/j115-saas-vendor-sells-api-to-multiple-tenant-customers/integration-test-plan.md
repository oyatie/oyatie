# j115-saas-vendor-sells-api-to-multiple-tenant-customers - Integration test plan

Purpose: prove that TenantF AIScribe sells API access to KrampusCorp, HealthcareSystem-Megacorp, and BoutiqueRetailer
with per-customer metering, Stripe usage billing, and per-tenant Cedar permits.

## Test environment

- Test tenants: tenant-aiscribe-london, tenant-krampuscorp-seoul, tenant-healthcaresystem-megacorp,
  tenant-boutiqueretailer-saopaulo.
- Test clock: deterministic HLC with per-region skew injection.
- Test policy: Cedar default-deny loaded first; permits are published after signature verification and soak.
- Test data: synthetic, non-production, no secrets, no live rails.
- Test contracts: OpenAPI 3.2.0, AsyncAPI 3.1.0, proto3, JSON Schema 2020-12.
