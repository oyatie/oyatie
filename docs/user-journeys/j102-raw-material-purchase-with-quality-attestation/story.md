# j102-raw-material-purchase-with-quality-attestation - Story

Purpose: KrampusCorp purchases specialty steel from AcmeRawMaterials through the marketplace, binds material provenance
to SLSA-class attestations, and dual-seals evidence in audit-chain.

## Load-bearing doctrine

- Oyatie is itself a tenant; no internal carve-out exists for this journey.
- Every human keeps continuity of identity through passkey identity while acting under distinct tenant memberships.
- Work surfaces are tenant-owned; personal surfaces remain personal-tenant-owned and Cedar default-deny protects them.
- A parent-child or facilitator relationship is a Cedar permit row, not ownership of a child tenant.
- Every two-party deal settles through marketplace, even when the visible business object is a service, subscription,
  API entitlement, material shipment, or workforce contract.
- Every state-changing action emits an ADR-0263 audit-linked observability event and a dual-sealed audit-chain entry.
- DRMP is active across detection, risk scoring, mitigation, and prevention rather than as a post-incident checklist.
- Cross-jurisdiction conflicts resolve by higher-restriction-wins while preserving the personal-tenant boundary.

## Act 1: tenant admission

### Beat 001 - marketplace moves the relationship forward
- Narrative: Min-seo Park sees AcmeRawMaterials Hamburg as a sovereign counterparty, not an owned record inside
  tenant-krampuscorp-seoul.
- Business texture: the decision matters because delay affects cash, inventory, staffing, compliance attestations, or
  customer trust in supply-chain/procurement.
- Emotional texture: the UI shows enough context for confidence without leaking personal-tenant data or overexposing
  another tenant.
- Cross-tenant action: marketplace receives a scoped request with tenant pair `tenant-krampuscorp-seoul` ->
  `tenant-krampuscorp-seoul` and refuses any unstamped call.
- Cedar gate: permit `journey.j102.marketplace.act_1` binds principal, action, resource, purpose, jurisdiction, and
  expiry.
- Marketplace doctrine: the economic consideration is represented as a marketplace deal set even when fulfillment is
  delegated to marketplace.
- Audit and observability: TenantGrantProposed carries tenant_id, sub_scope_path, traceparent, cost center, and audit_id
