# j143 — UX flow (export workflow + cross-tenant import)

## Section A — Initiation (T+0 to T+5m)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A.1 | Work-Drive read-only banner with green "Export portfolio" CTA | drive (work) | `b2b.drive.export.preview` | `DriveExportPreviewed` | "DLP scrub will apply; Karim attests" |
| A.2 | Export-preview dialog: 3 categories listed with counts; 2 blocked categories explained | drive (work) | (same) | none | Counts: 1,140 / 3 / 147 / blocked 4,212 / blocked 8,801 |
| A.3 | Confirmation: "Begin Export" | drive (work) | `b2b.drive.export.execute` | `ExportWorkflowStarted` | |
| A.4 | Progress drawer opens: live workflow status | workflow-engine | none | `WorkflowStarted` | Visual: 18-step checklist |

## Section B — DLP scrub + Karim review (T+5m to T+25m)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B.1 | Workflow progress: "DLP scrub running... 412/1290 files cleared" | compliance | none | `DLPScrubPass1InProgress` | Live progress bar |
| B.2 | Workflow progress: "4 files awaiting HR attestation (Karim)" | workflow-engine | none | `RequestKarimAttestation` | Soft-yellow indicator |
| B.3 | (Karim's screen on his HR shell) | drive + compliance | `b2b.drive.export.manual_review` | `ManualReviewSurfaced` | Karim sees 4 files inline with redactions suggested |
| B.4 | Karim's attest button | workflow-engine | `b2b.workflow.export.attest` | `ScrubAttestationSigned` | Signed event |
| B.5 | Chris's view: "Karim attested; bundling now" | workflow-engine | none | `BundleArchiveStarted` | |

## Section C — Cross-tenant transfer (T+25m to T+30m)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C.1 | "Transferring to your personal-Drive..." progress | drive (work → personal cross-tenant) | `b2b.drive.export.execute_cross_tenant` + `b2c.drive.import.accept` | `WorkDriveExportSealed` + `WorkDriveImportSealed` (HLC merge) | Both seals visible |
| C.2 | "Transfer complete. Personal-Mail confirmation sent." | mail | (auto-receive) | `MailDeliveredToPersonal` | |
| C.3 | (Chris switches to personal laptop) | drive (personal) | none | `PersonalDriveOpened` | |
| C.4 | Personal-Drive: new folder `imports/2026-06-01-former-employer-export/` | drive (personal) | none | none | 1,290 files visible |
| C.5 | README-for-future-employer.md opened | drive viewer | `b2c.drive.read` | `FileOpened` | Attestation receipt visible |

## Section D — References (T+3d to T+10d)

| # | Screen | µservice | Cedar | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D.1 | Personal-Mail: new "References & credentials" folder appears | mail (personal) | `b2c.mail.folder.auto_create` | `MailFolderCreated` | Folder auto-created when first reference letter arrives |
| D.2 | Mary's reference-letter email opened | mail (personal) | (read) | `MailOpened` | Tagged `is_reference_letter=true` |
| D.3 | Peer-references (Diego/Karen/Anil) arrive over the next week | mail (personal) | (read) | (same) | Tagged `is_peer_reference=true` |
| D.4 | Right-click "Save to /References/" — moves attachments to personal-Drive | drive (personal) | `b2c.drive.write` | `FileSaved` | |

## Section E — Edge cases

- **Export attempted at T+31d** → Cedar denies (preview was previewed but execute window expired). UX: dialog "Export window expired; contact HR for archival access."
- **DLP scrub bot crashes mid-run** → workflow checkpoints state every 100 files; resumes from last checkpoint.
- **Karim out-of-office** → workflow holds at "awaiting attestation" with notice in Chris's progress drawer; option to escalate to backup HR attestor.
- **Personal-tenant refuses import** (Cedar default-deny path tested) → workflow stays at step 10 with retry every 24h; Chris sees notice "Personal-tenant declined import; review your import policy."

## Section F — Anti-leak invariants

1. The export-preview MUST NOT show file content for DLP-blocked files (only counts).
2. The bundle MUST NOT include the DLP-pack source content (only its SHA-256 reference).
3. The bundle attestation receipt MUST NOT include customer-data even in reference; only file-count summaries by classification.
4. Manual-review escalation to Karim MUST present a redaction tool; Karim MUST NOT be able to "approve as-is" a file flagged for redaction.

## Completion expansion — j143 ux rigor pass
