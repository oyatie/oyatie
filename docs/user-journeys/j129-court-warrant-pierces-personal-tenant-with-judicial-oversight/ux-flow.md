# j129 — UX flow: warrant piercing notification + transparency surface

## 0. Devices in play

## 1. DOJ side — warrant submission UI

```

UI invariant: cross-tenant scope-builder defaults to narrow scope.
Adding broader scope requires explicit Cedar policy override (which
the platform refuses without supplemental warrant authority).

## 2. Diana side — notification on iPhone

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏠 Personal — Diana             │

│  [Full warrant] [Contact legal   │
│  aid] [Acknowledge]              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

UI invariants:
- Notification appears within 60 seconds of warrant validation.
- Scope is listed in plain language, not just legalese.
- "Contact legal aid" link surfaces oyatie's pro-bono legal-aid
  referral list (per pack-publisher-source-protection grammar).
- "Full warrant" downloads the magistrate-signed PDF.

## 3. Diana's personal-tenant active permits view

After warrant goes active, Diana can browse her tenant's active
Cedar permits:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Diana can SEE the warrant exists. She cannot revoke it (court order).
She CAN see what was accessed under it (audit-chain detail view).

## 4. The DOJ pull session UI

(Out of Diana's view, but architecturally important.)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  oyatie Legal Process — Pull Session                     │

│   - messenger.read_thread (reyes-family) DENIED          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Defense-in-depth: even the DOJ prosecutor sees the boundary
enforcement; the platform refuses out-of-scope queries.

## 5. Public transparency report (Q3 2026)

```

Diana's case is one of the 7. She is not named. The aggregate is
audited against the audit-chain count.

## 6. UX invariants

1. **Notice within 60s** unless court-issued no-notice provision.
2. **Subject-tenant visibility into permit** — Diana sees the
   warrant in her permit list.
3. **Subject visibility into access log** — Diana sees exactly
   what was accessed (after-the-fact, scoped to her tenant).
4. **Out-of-scope denial visible to all parties** — DOJ + Diana
   + audit-chain.
5. **Warrant canary published quarterly** with aggregate counts.
6. **Legal aid link is mandatory** on notice screen.

## 7. Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA across notice + permit views. Tabbed structures
keyboard-navigable. Legal terminology has tooltip plain-language
translations.

## 8. Cross-references

- `story.md`, `handshake.md`
- ADR-0312, ADR-0311, ADR-0300

## Completion expansion — j129 ux rigor pass

Scope: court warrant pierces personal tenant only through scoped judicial review.
Persona: Diana Reyes.
Services: identity + audit-chain + compliance + governance + workflow-engine + community.
Applicable ADRs: ADR-0244, ADR-0299, ADR-0311, ADR-0312, ADR-0313, ADR-0319.
