# j111-staffing-agency-as-tenant-facilitator - Integration test plan

Purpose: prove that A staffing-agency tenant sources workers from Community, places them at KrampusCorp, ConstructionCo,
and HealthcareSystem-Megacorp, and receives Stripe facilitator commissions.

## Test environment

- Test tenants: tenant-staffing-agency-global, tenant-krampuscorp-seoul, tenant-constructionco-sydney,
  tenant-healthcaresystem-megacorp.
- Test clock: deterministic HLC with per-region skew injection.
- Test policy: Cedar default-deny loaded first; permits are published after signature verification and soak.
- Test data: synthetic, non-production, no secrets, no live rails.
- Test contracts: OpenAPI 3.2.0, AsyncAPI 3.1.0, proto3, JSON Schema 2020-12.
