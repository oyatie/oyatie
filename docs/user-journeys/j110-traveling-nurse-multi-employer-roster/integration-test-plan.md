# j110-traveling-nurse-multi-employer-roster - Integration test plan

Purpose: prove that HealthcareSystem-Megacorp recruits one nurse to work shifts across three hospital tenants with
per-shift Cedar permits, per-hospital identity binding, and payroll cascade.

## Test environment

- Test tenants: tenant-healthcaresystem-megacorp, tenant-hospital-east, tenant-hospital-west, tenant-hospital-rural,
  b2c-nora-ellis.
- Test clock: deterministic HLC with per-region skew injection.
- Test policy: Cedar default-deny loaded first; permits are published after signature verification and soak.
- Test data: synthetic, non-production, no secrets, no live rails.
- Test contracts: OpenAPI 3.2.0, AsyncAPI 3.1.0, proto3, JSON Schema 2020-12.
