# j87 - Integration test plan

## Test topology

- Journey object schema: `schemas/fedramp-il5-airgap.json`.
- Services under test: identity, tenancy, cell, cloud-iac, cloud-k8s, cloud-secrets, audit-chain, compliance, observability, ops-dashboard-control-center, governance, network, workflow-engine.
- Contract versions: OpenAPI 3.2.0 external APIs, AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event channels, proto3 internal RPC.
- Policy engine: Cedar deny-wins, with explicit negative tests for missing tenant, stale pack receipt, wrong data class, and cross-border conflict.
- Audit: ADR-0263 events are asserted for start, commit, denial, rollback, and final receipt.

Expected: PERMIT only when tenant_id, purpose, data_class, pack_id, and jurisdiction all align.
Negative assertion: DENY on missing pack receipt, conflicting jurisdiction, anonymous service path, or provider-BYOK/encryption-BYOK collapse.
Audit assertion: start, decision, mutation, and completion events are sealed and linked by prior_seal_ref.
Observability assertion: histogram and counter labels stay below the cardinality budget and contain no personal data.
Rollback assertion: injected failure returns state to pre-step value while preserving append-only audit history.
Evidence: test stores the correlation id, event class list, and schema validation result in the journey evidence bundle.

### Test 027 - identity / rollback-path
Purpose: prove identity honors NIST SP 800-53 Rev5 control inheritance for `fedramp-il5-airgap`.
Setup: seed tenant, subject, pack receipt, Cedar policy bundle, idempotency key, deadline clock, and service fixture.
Action: submit the journey envelope through the same OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or proto3 path used in production.
Expected: PERMIT only when tenant_id, purpose, data_class, pack_id, and jurisdiction all align.
Negative assertion: DENY on missing pack receipt, conflicting jurisdiction, anonymous service path, or provider-BYOK/encryption-BYOK collapse.
Audit assertion: start, decision, mutation, and completion events are sealed and linked by prior_seal_ref.
Observability assertion: histogram and counter labels stay below the cardinality budget and contain no personal data.
Rollback assertion: injected failure returns state to pre-step value while preserving append-only audit history.
Evidence: test stores the correlation id, event class list, and schema validation result in the journey evidence bundle.

### Test 028 - tenancy / duplicate-idempotency-key
Purpose: prove tenancy honors NIST SP 800-137 continuous monitoring for `fedramp-il5-airgap`.
Setup: seed tenant, subject, pack receipt, Cedar policy bundle, idempotency key, deadline clock, and service fixture.
Action: submit the journey envelope through the same OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or proto3 path used in production.
Expected: PERMIT only when tenant_id, purpose, data_class, pack_id, and jurisdiction all align.
Negative assertion: DENY on missing pack receipt, conflicting jurisdiction, anonymous service path, or provider-BYOK/encryption-BYOK collapse.
Audit assertion: start, decision, mutation, and completion events are sealed and linked by prior_seal_ref.
Observability assertion: histogram and counter labels stay below the cardinality budget and contain no personal data.
Rollback assertion: injected failure returns state to pre-step value while preserving append-only audit history.
Evidence: test stores the correlation id, event class list, and schema validation result in the journey evidence bundle.

### Test 029 - cell / byok-provider-confusion
Purpose: prove cell honors DoD Cloud Computing SRG IL5 for `fedramp-il5-airgap`.
Setup: seed tenant, subject, pack receipt, Cedar policy bundle, idempotency key, deadline clock, and service fixture.
Action: submit the journey envelope through the same OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or proto3 path used in production.
Expected: PERMIT only when tenant_id, purpose, data_class, pack_id, and jurisdiction all align.
Negative assertion: DENY on missing pack receipt, conflicting jurisdiction, anonymous service path, or provider-BYOK/encryption-BYOK collapse.
Audit assertion: start, decision, mutation, and completion events are sealed and linked by prior_seal_ref.
Observability assertion: histogram and counter labels stay below the cardinality budget and contain no personal data.
Rollback assertion: injected failure returns state to pre-step value while preserving append-only audit history.
Evidence: test stores the correlation id, event class list, and schema validation result in the journey evidence bundle.
