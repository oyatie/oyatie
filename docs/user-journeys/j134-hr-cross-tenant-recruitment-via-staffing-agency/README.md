# j134 — Cross-tenant recruitment via staffing agency

## At a glance

Marcus's tenant engages HireForce (3rd-party staffing-agency tenant) to fill 7 senior+staff-level reqs in Austin and Berlin. HireForce sources candidates; marcus-tenant interviews + extends offers; Stripe facilitator-flow handles per-placement-fee (22% of salary) with replacement-guarantee window. Demonstrates the platform's 3-tenant ecosystem primitive (employer + agency + candidate personal-tenant).

## Why this journey matters

j134 shows oyatie's ecosystem extensibility: a third-party tenant (staffing agency) plugs into the HR workflow without bespoke integration, with Cedar permits + Connect-trust providing data isolation, and Stripe providing the financial mechanic. The candidate's personal-tenant remains invisible to both employer and agency throughout — per ADR-0311.

## Personas

- **Priya Krishnan (primary)** — Marcus's HR Director.
- **Aaron Patel** — HireForce account rep for marcus-tenant.
- **Yuki Tanaka** — Aaron's senior manager.
- **Devika Rao** — one of the 7 placed candidates (case study).
- **7 placement candidates** — varied; sourced by HireForce.

## µservices touched (6)

| µservice | Role in j134 |
|---|---|
| community | Cross-tenant req posting + shortlist + cohort surfaces |
| workflow-engine | Engagement workflow + offer extension + 90-day check + replacement-guarantee |
| identity | Cross-tenant principal resolution + audience-type transitions + SCIM provisioning |
| tenancy | Connect-trust verification + 3-tenant scope |
| payments | Stripe facilitator-flow + escrow + per-placement disbursement + refund |
| workplace-integration | Engagement agreement + per-jurisdiction offer-letter (Austin + Berlin) |

## Key ADRs surfaced

- **ADR-0311** — 3-tenant boundary; candidate personal-tenant invisible to both employer and agency
- **ADR-0244** — `B2B_STAFFING_AGENCY` + `B2B_STAFFING_AGENCY_CANDIDATE` audience-types
- **ADR-0249** — multi-category marketplace primitive supports staffing-agency category
- **ADR-0263** — 17 audit-event classes
- **ADR-0292** — accessibility floor

## Labor-law anchors

- US: IRS Form W-9 + 1099-NEC (not applicable — these are perm-hires; agency receives fee, candidates are employees of marcus-tenant); AB-5 California independent-contractor test (not applicable)
- EU: Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008/104/EC (not applicable — perm-hires not temp-dispatch); DE-AÜG (not applicable for perm-hires)
- KR: Act on the Protection of Dispatched Workers (not applicable)
- IN: Contract Labour Act 1970 (not applicable)

(j134's hires are direct-employment with HireForce as recruiter, not contractor-dispatch. Different journey would cover contractor-dispatch.)

- Cedar policy engineers: read handshake.md + permit-bundle schema
- Finance engineers: read payments IP + Stripe facilitator details
- Marketplace engineers: read story.md ch7 + multi-category-marketplace ADR-0249
