> **Owner:** `ops-sre-reliability`
> **Severity scope:** Sev 3

## Symptom
scheduled game-day chaos exercise

## Detection
- Source signal: Game-day schedule
- Page who: per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md) Sev 3 ladder

## First-response checklist
1. Acknowledge page; declare incident in #incident-bridge
2. Open the SLO dashboard for the affected surface
3. Capture the audit-chain segment for the impact window per ADR-0003
4. Apply the immediate stop-bleeding step listed in §"Containment"
5. Notify owner team's on-call rotation per RACI

## Containment
Notify all affected teams; freeze production changes during game-day window

## Diagnosis
Execute per-game-day scenario per chaos-engineering catalog

## Recovery
Restore production; emit per-game-day report; file gaps as MFL rows + tracking issues

## Verify-recovery
- Confirm SLO error budget recovers within Sev 3 recovery SLO
- Confirm audit-chain integrity per ADR-0003
- Run the per-axis fitness lane that originally would have caught this; if it did not, file a prevention ticket per [`standards/prevention-doctrine.md`](../../standards/prevention-doctrine.md)

## Post-incident
- Author postmortem within Sev 3 SLA per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Add row to [`MISTAKES-LEDGER.md`](../../MISTAKES-LEDGER.md) with mechanical-prevention proposal
- Emit `EVT-PREVENTION-SHIPPED` per ADR-0003 once prevention lands
