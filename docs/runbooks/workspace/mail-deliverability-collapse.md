# Oyatie Runbook — Workspace Mail Deliverability Collapse

> **Status:** Stub (P0 must-have for W-Foundation gate per [`RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md`](../../RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md))
> **Owner:** `axis-workspace`
> **Severity scope:** Sev 2

## Symptom
outbound mail delivery rate has collapsed; bounce rate spiked; reputation degraded

## Detection
- Source signal: Per-domain reputation dashboard; bounce-rate SLO breach; per-pack postmaster alerts
- Page who: per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md) Sev 2 ladder

## First-response checklist
1. Acknowledge page; declare incident in #incident-bridge
2. Open the SLO dashboard for the affected surface
3. Capture the audit-chain segment for the impact window per ADR-0003
4. Apply the immediate stop-bleeding step listed in §"Containment"
5. Notify owner team's on-call rotation per RACI

## Containment
Throttle outbound from affected domain(s); identify whether spam-source compromise caused listing

## Diagnosis
Check DKIM / SPF / DMARC alignment; check IP reputation; check inbound spam-source compromise

## Recovery
Restore reputation per per-pack ESP playbook; rotate sending IPs if reputation is unrecoverable; ship per-tenant outbound rate-limit if abuse-driven

## Verify-recovery
- Confirm SLO error budget recovers within Sev 2 recovery SLO
- Confirm audit-chain integrity per ADR-0003
- Run the per-axis fitness lane that originally would have caught this; if it did not, file a prevention ticket per [`standards/prevention-doctrine.md`](../../standards/prevention-doctrine.md)

## Post-incident
- Author postmortem within Sev 2 SLA per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Add row to [`MISTAKES-LEDGER.md`](../../MISTAKES-LEDGER.md) with mechanical-prevention proposal
- Emit `EVT-PREVENTION-SHIPPED` per ADR-0003 once prevention lands
