# Oyatie Runbook — Ads Data Use Boundary Violation

> **Status:** Stub (P0 must-have for W-Foundation gate per [`RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md`](../../RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md))
> **Owner:** `axis-ads-analytics + council-privacy`
> **Severity scope:** Sev 1
> **Authored from:** [`templates/runbook-template.md`](../../templates/runbook-template.md)
> **Last verified:** 2026-05-09 (stub authored; full procedure landed at W-Foundation gate)

## Symptom
an ads-side surface received data from a forbidden data_class per ADR-0008

## Detection
- Source signal: Ads-side schema rejection log; `governance-data-class` runtime block
- Page who: per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md) Sev 1 ladder

## First-response checklist
1. Acknowledge page; declare incident in #incident-bridge
2. Open the SLO dashboard for the affected surface
3. Capture the audit-chain segment for the impact window per ADR-0003
4. Apply the immediate stop-bleeding step listed in §"Containment"
5. Notify owner team's on-call rotation per RACI

## Containment
Block the affected ad-targeting flow; preserve the schema diff + caller chain

## Diagnosis
Walk caller chain; verify singleton allowlist enforcement (platform-ads-gate is the only legitimate source)

## Recovery
Patch the source service or remove the call site; verify with replay; emit MFL row + ship fitness lane

## Verify-recovery
- Confirm SLO error budget recovers within Sev 1 recovery SLO
- Confirm audit-chain integrity per ADR-0003
- Run the per-axis fitness lane that originally would have caught this; if it did not, file a prevention ticket per [`standards/prevention-doctrine.md`](../../standards/prevention-doctrine.md)

## Post-incident
- Author postmortem within Sev 1 SLA per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Add row to [`MISTAKES-LEDGER.md`](../../MISTAKES-LEDGER.md) with mechanical-prevention proposal
- Emit `EVT-PREVENTION-SHIPPED` per ADR-0003 once prevention lands
