# Oyatie Runbook — SERP Quality Regression

> **Status:** Stub (P0 must-have for W-Foundation gate per [`RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md`](../../RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md))
> **Owner:** `axis-search`
> **Severity scope:** Sev 3
> **Authored from:** [`templates/runbook-template.md`](../../templates/runbook-template.md)

## Symptom
SERP quality metrics regressed (NDCG, CTR, satisfaction proxy)

## Detection
- Source signal: Per-query-class quality dashboard; ranker eval anomaly
- Page who: per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md) Sev 3 ladder

## First-response checklist
1. Acknowledge page; declare incident in #incident-bridge
2. Open the SLO dashboard for the affected surface
3. Capture the audit-chain segment for the impact window per ADR-0003
4. Apply the immediate stop-bleeding step listed in §"Containment"
5. Notify owner team's on-call rotation per RACI

## Containment
Hold the ranker rollout at the affected percentile; preserve eval traces

## Diagnosis
Compare failing query class against golden + adversarial cohorts; identify regression class

## Recovery
Either rollback ranker or patch; ship eval-cohort update; emit MFL row if gate failed open

## Verify-recovery
- Confirm SLO error budget recovers within Sev 3 recovery SLO
- Confirm audit-chain integrity per ADR-0003
- Run the per-axis fitness lane that originally would have caught this; if it did not, file a prevention ticket per [`standards/prevention-doctrine.md`](../../standards/prevention-doctrine.md)

## Post-incident
- Author postmortem within Sev 3 SLA per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Add row to [`MISTAKES-LEDGER.md`](../../MISTAKES-LEDGER.md) with mechanical-prevention proposal
- Emit `EVT-PREVENTION-SHIPPED` per ADR-0003 once prevention lands
