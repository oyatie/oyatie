> **Status:** Stub (P0 must-have for W-Foundation gate per [`RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md`](../../RUNBOOKS-INDEX.md))
> **Owner:** `axis-search`
> **Severity scope:** Sev 3

## Symptom
a host is blocking the Oyatie crawler (rate-limit, IP block, robots.txt rule, or legal request)

## Detection
- Source signal: Crawler error-rate per host; per-host fetch-success dashboard
- Page who: per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md) Sev 3 ladder

## First-response checklist
1. Acknowledge page; declare incident in #incident-bridge
2. Open the SLO dashboard for the affected surface
3. Capture the audit-chain segment for the impact window per ADR-0003
4. Apply the immediate stop-bleeding step listed in §"Containment"
5. Notify owner team's on-call rotation per RACI

## Containment
Pause crawl on the affected host; notify the host owner via webmaster contact

## Diagnosis
Identify block reason: rate, IP, robots.txt, or takedown

## Recovery
Honor the block; coordinate with host if false-positive; per legal request: take-down per RTBF cascade

## Verify-recovery
- Confirm SLO error budget recovers within Sev 3 recovery SLO
- Confirm audit-chain integrity per ADR-0003
- Run the per-axis fitness lane that originally would have caught this; if it did not, file a prevention ticket per [`standards/prevention-doctrine.md`](../../standards/prevention-doctrine.md)

## Post-incident
- Author postmortem within Sev 3 SLA per [INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md](../../INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT.md)
- Add row to [`MISTAKES-LEDGER.md`](../../MISTAKES-LEDGER.md) with mechanical-prevention proposal
- Emit `EVT-PREVENTION-SHIPPED` per ADR-0003 once prevention lands
