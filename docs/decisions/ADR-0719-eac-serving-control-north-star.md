# ADR-0719: EaC north star — serving vs control, proto IR, packs

## Status

**Accepted** (founder 2026-08-21). Amends the live identity/authz, k8s-port, product-protocol,
and platform-foundations apexes. Does not archive them.

Chat/session architecture is not law. This file is.

## Context

The platform was sketched as Everything-as-Code (EaC) plus Cedar and Zanzibar-pattern ReBAC,
then challenged at hundreds of millions of RPS, against AWS’s closed etcd-journal, and against
Eurozone (and KR) law. Three mistakes were available: (1) put serving state in etcd/CRDs or a
remote PDP; (2) treat JSON/REST/Helm as the product because they are familiar; (3) copy GDPR
as a global floor and copy Zanzibar’s worldwide ACL replica.

Hyperscalers split **serving** (memory, local, constant-work) from **control** (journal,
lower RPS). Zanzibar 2019: >10M client QPS, ~200M cache lookups/s, Spanner behind the
watch, not etcd on `Check`. EKS rebuilt etcd (Raft → internal journal, BoltDB → tmpfs) to
sell **one 100k-node Kubernetes**. GKE used Spanner behind the apiserver watch cache. We
sell a **cloud** sharded by **cells**, not a 100k-node logo.

## Decision

### D-1 — Serving vs control

- **Serving path** (product RPC + `Check`, 10^8-class fleet): Maglev-class anycast, then
  one logical L7 gateway, then **in-process PEP**, then **in-process PDP** on a **cell-local
  RAM snapshot** (compiled Cedar + ReBAC shards + product cache). Lookups ≫ RPCs. RPC
  `Check` is miss / recent-zookie / cross-cell only.
- **Control path** (IR apply, pack sign, tuple write, schedule, SLO, billing close):
  journaled, sharded, 10^3–10^5 class. First-party IR may live in git. Tenant IR lives on
  the gateway API.
- **Scheduler** = kube-scheduler (pods) + cell placement (tenants). Not an EaC scheduler.
- **Orchestrator** = `workflow` for business sagas. Apply order is `iac`’s object graph.
- **Monitor** = `observability` + `audit` + `iac` drift. No `eac-monitor`.
- **Audit on serving:** two classes. Privileged / admin / payroll-approve / policy-publish
  persist evidence **before ACK**. Other `Check`s may be async/sampled. Silent drop under
  load on privileged class is forbidden (DORA/NIS2-shaped).

**MUST (serving store)**

- **achieves:** 10^8-class `Check` and product RPC without a consensus box on the hit path.
- **origin:** etcd/Raft and remote PDP-RPC were drawn as if they were Borg/Zanzibar.
- **rule:** serving state is cell-local memory snapshots; consensus/journal is off the hit path.
- **ensure:** no PR stores tuples, IR, or tenant documents as etcd keys or product CRDs.
- **overturn_when:** a measured serving path needs a different store AND a replacement ADR
  with five fields lands same-wave.

### D-2 — k8s / etcd / “AWS journal”

`k8s/` remains the owned control plane + managed-k8s facade (ADR-0704). Its durable store
is **cluster objects in a cell** (pods, nodes, VAP params), served from an apiserver
**watch cache**. Vanilla Talos etcd Raft is accepted **only** until `k8s/ports` grows an
owned journal+memory adapter.

Do **not** adopt Amazon’s EKS journal. It is closed, not OSS, clock/hardware-shaped, and
exists to preserve the **etcd API** for a Kubernetes vendor. Steal the split (log vs
memory, no single Raft leader on the hot path). Implement the log ourselves behind the
port, cell-local, MIT/Apache. Cells, not one mega-cluster, are the scale lever.

### D-3 — EaC shape

EaC is **one protobuf IR** (Rust contract → Protobuf Editions) plus **per-plane
reconcilers**. Unifier: platform ∧ pack ∧ app ∧ tenant. Helm, Tofu, CUE, Timoni, Haskell,
and Kyverno/Kubewarden are **not** sources of desired state. Helm may exist only as an
`iac` **adapter** that renders third-party charts into objects **validated against the IR**.

There is no mega `EaService` that owns policy + infra + SLOs. Plane APIs stay plane APIs.
A thin IR `validate` / `unify` / `preview` / `apply` / `watch` fans out. The SDK is
generated from the IDL. Console is a client of the same methods. Apps (`app/<product>/`)
are **IR modules** on the cloud, not private Helm worlds.

**MUST (no wrap language, no JSON product codec)**

- **achieves:** one evolution story; JSON/YAML/Helm dual stacks cannot become the product.
- **origin:** public REST+JSON and Helm-as-source were compatibility fossils and corpus.
- **rule:** product and IR contracts are protobuf; JSON is not a product codec; wrap
  languages are not EaC.
- **ensure:** new surfaces take types from the Rust/proto SSOT; gates do not require JSON
  censuses (`manifest.json`, scorecard dumps) as existence proofs.
- **overturn_when:** a pack or Data-Act export format is separately Accepted as
  **control-plane dump**, not as the serving API.

Leftover REST/JSON public shapes are **reorg_now deletion**, not a supported codec.
Temporarily breaking callers is accepted; a dual REST+proto product API is not.

### D-4 — Protocol (no pre-2016 compatibility as destination)

North star wire: HTTP/3 + protobuf, Connect-class HTTP (no gRPC trailers), WebTransport for
watches. Identity on the channel: SPIFFE mTLS east-west; passkeys at L2; **step-up to L3/L4**
(KR 본인인증 / eIDAS EUDI / passport+liveness per interview D58) via Cedar `acr_required`.
PQC + ECH at the edge (ADR-0354). Public gRPC-Web is not the console protocol. FlatBuffers
remain a measured adapter, never a second SSOT.

`Check` is never a public method. Product RPCs are. PEPs call the in-cell PDP.

### D-5 — Authz placement (ADR-0615 stands, topology corrected)

`policy/` is the Cedar PDP + ReBAC tuple plane (G-face distribute, C0 in-cell snapshot).
`iam/` emits the principal. Stale snapshot denies or routes; never silent allow.

**ReBAC is cell-local.** Zanzibar’s “replicate all ACLs worldwide” is rejected: tuples and
group memberships are personal data; global replica fails residency (E18, ADR-0049, GDPR
transfers, KR CSAP). Cross-cell `Check` is an explicit Cedar’d hop.

Subject IDs in tuples, logs, and meters are **opaque handles** under the subject DEK
(interview D10). Erasure is crypto-shred + unlink. Legal retention (D11) is pack data and
blocks shred for that class only. Merkle+TSA (D86) hashes the control log; it does not
store PII and does not sync-append every `Check`.

### D-6 — Packs, not “EU = world”

- **achieves:** sell KR and EU (and later US/others) without a fake global GDPR floor.
- **origin:** “strictest common subset = EU” fails KR (CSAP, 본인인증, RRN, e-tax, K-GAAP
  retention) and fails CN localization; DORA/AI Act/eIDAS are not universal.
- **rule:** jurisdiction law is **pack overlay** on the same IR/Cedar/ReBAC/cells. EU is
  one pack (`packs/eu`). KR is one pack (`packs/kr`). Structural controls that help many
  regimes (crypto-shred, certified cells, purpose in Cedar, two-class evidence, published
  proto + event-log export) live in the platform; the rest lives in the pack.
- **ensure:** no PR encodes EU-only identity or worldwide ACL replica as default; cell
  placement refuses a pack that exceeds the cell’s certification (E18).
- **overturn_when:** a single jurisdiction is the only remaining market AND a replacement
  ADR says so.

EU next-decade instruments (GDPR tightening, DORA, NIS2, AI Act, Data Act, CRA, eIDAS 2)
are **inputs to `packs/eu`**, not a reason to delete KR-shaped L3 or legal-retention
classes. Data Act switching is a **control-plane dump** of the event log and proofs, not a
JSON public API.

### D-7 — 3-year no-regret / regret

**Keep even if implementations swap:** cells; serving RAM vs control journal; Cedar+ReBAC
in-cell; proto IDL; in-process `Check`; k8s store behind a port; apps as IR modules;
two-class evidence; shreddable principals; eIDAS/KR step-up; owned cell journal; one
gateway; packs.

**Regret:** etcd as product DB; AWS closed journal; JSON as product codec; Helm-as-source;
Kyverno/Kubewarden as default; one global cluster; worldwide ACL replica; silent drop of
privileged evidence; passkeys as L3; unpublished binary lock-in; EU-as-only-baseline;
cap-root census files; dual `cedar/`+`policy/` children.

### D-8 — Repo root and capability / app root (amends ADR-0701)

A directory or file is allowed only if something that is **not a census gate** loads it,
or it is `OWNERS` / short `README.md` / `BUCK` / `app/<product>/PRD.md`. Git history is
the audit log. Do not invent a destination for leftovers; many must **not exist**.

**Repo root (closed).** Workspace: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`,
`rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml`, `reindeer.toml`, `.buckconfig`, `.buckroot`, `.cargo/`.
GitHub: `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`. Hubs: `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
`OWNERS`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, founder-thin `HANDOFF.md`. Meta: `kernel/`, `os/`,
`base/` (≥3 caps and strictly below them, else it is not `base/`), `build/`,
`third-party/`. `governance/` is a **capability** (checks + `capability-registry.json`).
`specs/` is the **singleton org machine-readable tree gates already load** (root-hub,
masterplan, schemas); shrink unused rows, do not dual-home under `governance/` or
`registry/`. Composition: `app/`. One directory per **registered** capability
(including `policy/` the **engine**). Jurisdiction: `packs/<id>/` one versioned bundle
the engines load. `docs/` = ADRs + operating contract.

**Not repo-root:** `oya/`, `cloud/`, `libs/`, `infra/`, `tools/`, `toolchains/`
(reorg_now); root `Makefile`; root `Dockerfile*` (→ `build/`); `oya-*.toml`; tracked
agent dirs; `evidence/` dumps; `benchmarks/`; `scripts/`; `tasks/`/`plan/` as required
corpora; `catalog.yaml` trees; root `contracts/` YAML as IDL; root `registry/` as a
third org tree.

**Capability root and `app/<product>/` (closed children):** `core/`, `ports/`,
`adapters/`, `facade/`, `cedar/` (**.cedar unique to this cap** — schema and resource
policies the PDP compiles; platform templates live under the `policy/` **capability**,
not stamped here), `observability/slos/` (**generated OpenSLO from IR only** — hand-authored OpenSLO,
including “unique” files, is debt; clones already forbidden), `iac/` (IR the reconciler
applies, not Helm/Tofu source), `OWNERS`,
short `README.md`, `BUCK`. `app/<product>/` may add `PRD.md`. No cap-root `contracts/`
(IDL is Rust → proto on `ports/` / generated faces). No cap-root `policy/` (that name
is the engine at repo root). Nested leftover service trees become faces or go.

**Must not exist at cap/app root:** `manifest.json` census, `catalog.yaml`, `IPs/`,
`IP-journey-*.md`, `AUDIT-FINDINGS-*.json`, `REMEDIATION-NOTES-*.md`, `scorecards/`,
`dashboards/*.json`, `dpia/`, `decisions/` copies, `capabilities/*.yaml` essays,
stamped runbooks, stamped `tenant-scope.cedar` copies, dual ARCH files, placeholder
READMEs. Delete the gate with the files.

**Public door:** proto/H3 is the product. REST/JSON leftover is **deleted**, not
transcoded as a standing codec. No new public REST shapes. Console/SDK/gates that
still speak REST may go red until they speak proto — that break is in-scope hygiene.

**MUST (closed children)**

- **achieves:** engine vs data names do not collide; N copies of platform Cedar/SLO
  cannot reappear; org law has one tree gates already load.
- **origin:** naming `policy/` for both the PDP and per-cap Cedar followed the live
  tree; OpenSLO-as-authoring and REST transcode are Helm-shaped dual stacks; dual
  `cedar/`+`policy/` allowlists encoded the collision.
- **rule:** cap-root `cedar/` only; `policy/` is the capability; SLO source is IR;
  `specs/` is org-data SSOT; `ports/` is the contract face; extras and REST/JSON
  product surfaces deleted, not grandfathered. Temporarily breaking live callers/gates
  is accepted. Leaving anti-pattern debt is not.
- **ensure:** layout allowlists match this set; no immortal `IPs/`; no both `cedar/` and
  `policy/` as cap children.
- **overturn_when:** a child is loaded by a compiler/PDP/SLO/reconciler AND a five-field
  amendment lands same-wave.

## Consequences

- Implementers read this plus ADR-0701/0702/0704/0705/0615. Do not re-derive from chat.
- `policy/` extraction and IR proto are implementation follow-through, not optional sketch.
- Admission remains ADR-0710 (VAP/CEL+PSA); this ADR does not re-open ADR-0710's D-8.
- Merge-blocking CI is **presubmit** (one admission context, graph-aware work). Do not
  name it `oya-ci-required` in new law. Pair with `merge-admission` for queue
  admission. Per-capability required GitHub checks stay forbidden.

## Rejected alternatives

- AWS EKS etcd journal as our store.
- CUE+Timoni or Haskell as EaC wrap.
- Public JSON/REST as the destination codec.
- Zanzibar global tuple replica.
- EU GDPR as the sole compliance floor.
- Mega EaC orchestrator / remote PDP on the hit path.
- Sync Merkle on every `Check`.
- Cap-root `catalog.yaml` / `manifest.json` as allowlist debt.
- Cap-root `policy/` for Cedar files (collides with the `policy/` engine) or dual `cedar/`+`policy/` children.
- Rehoming AUDIT-FINDINGS, IPs, scorecards, DPIA essays into `docs/` instead of deleting.
- Cap-root `contracts/` or root `contracts/*.yaml` as IDL SSOT.
- Hand-authored OpenSLO (clones or “unique”) as SLO source of truth.
- Standing REST/JSON transcode “until SDK is ready” (that is dual-stack debt).
- Hand-authored OpenSLO as a W0 source of truth.
- Branding the merge-blocking CI `oya-ci-*` or adding one required check per capability.
