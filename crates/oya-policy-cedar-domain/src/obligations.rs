//! Cedar-style policy obligations and advice annotations.
//!
//! Annotations are key/value pairs attached to [`crate::PolicyRule`] at authoring
//! time and collected onto [`crate::AuthorizationDecision`] at evaluation time.
//!
//! # Forbid-wins invariant
//!
//! Annotations are surfaced **only** on Allow decisions.  A Deny win (explicit or
//! default) unconditionally yields an empty annotation list.  A Policy Enforcement
//! Point (PEP) that ignores `AuthorizationDecision::allowed == false` to consume
//! annotations would be bypassing the PDP; the empty-on-deny contract is enforced
//! inside [`crate::PolicySet::authorize`].
//!
//! # Cedar semantics
//!
//! Cedar distinguishes **obligations** (must-execute side effects the PEP is required
//! to act on) from **advice** (informational hints the PEP may use).  Both are
//! represented as `(kind, key, value)` triples.  [`AnnotationKind`] encodes the
//! distinction.
