# IP-journey-j79-social-moderation-surface - social

## Goal

Implement the `social-moderation-surface` slice for `social` so j79 can satisfy `EU-DSA` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/social/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j79-eu-dsa-transparency-semi-annual-report/.
- Regulator article focus: DSA Art 14 terms and conditions.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/social/contracts/openapi/j79-social-moderation-surface-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/social/contracts/asyncapi/j79-social-moderation-surface-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/social/contracts/proto/j79-social-moderation-surface-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/social/policy/j79-social-moderation-surface.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/social/runbooks/j79-social-moderation-surface-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/social/tests/j79_social_moderation_surface_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `dsa-transparency-report` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j79.social.social-moderation-surface", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "EU-DSA" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "EU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J79SocialSocialModerationSurfaceStarted`.
- `J79SocialSocialModerationSurfacePermitted`.
- `J79SocialSocialModerationSurfaceDenied`.
- `J79SocialSocialModerationSurfaceCommitted`.
- `J79SocialSocialModerationSurfaceRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - social social-moderation-surface
Scope: implement one social behavior for j79, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: DSA Art 14 terms and conditions.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 7 press freedom / journalist source.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

### IP row 023 - social social-moderation-surface
Scope: implement one social behavior for j79, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: DSA Art 34 systemic risk assessment.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 13 non-native-language user.
Contract: AsyncAPI 3.1.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.

## Wave 15 counterpart anchor

Slack is the grep-recognized community counterpart for this preserved journey IP: the social work must keep moderation, channels, broadcast context, DSA reporting, minor protection, and abuse-defense controls explicit instead of hiding them behind a generic activity-feed template.
