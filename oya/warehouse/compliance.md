# Compliance: Warehouse

## A. Scope
This compliance anchor covers Warehouse as part of SAP EWM parity. It declares the minimum control posture before Wave-3-G full artifact buildout.

## B. Control Families
- SOX 404: authorization, segregation of duties, evidence retention, control testing, and change approval.
- SOC 2: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- ISO 27001: asset inventory, access control, cryptography, logging, supplier relationship, incident response, and continuity.
- GDPR/LGPD/CPRA: data subject rights, lawful basis, retention, portability, deletion, and cross-border transfer controls.
- Jurisdictional tax: invoice, withholding, VAT/GST/sales tax, payroll or trade tax evidence where applicable.
- Industry packs: banking, insurance, healthcare, public sector, automotive, utilities, oil, pharma, and retail overlays activate only through pack metadata.

## C. Data Classification
- Tenant identifiers: confidential operational data.
- Source-system identifiers: confidential migration provenance.
- Financial or operational postings: regulated business records when applicable.
- Personal data: PII subject to jurisdictional pack rules.
- Trade, quality, maintenance, workforce, or lease evidence: regulated records when activated by pack.

## D. Audit Events

- EVT-WAREHOUSE-YARD_APPOINTMENT-REVERSED
- EVT-WAREHOUSE-LABOR_ASSIGNMENT-CREATED
- EVT-WAREHOUSE-LABOR_ASSIGNMENT-APPROVED
- EVT-WAREHOUSE-LABOR_ASSIGNMENT-REVERSED

## E. Required Evidence
- Cedar policy decision log for every mutation.
- Audit-chain event id for every critical state transition.
- Source-system row provenance for every migration import.
- Workflow run id for every approval, exception, reversal, or remediation.
- Data-residency decision for every regulated record.
- OpenBao reference for every secret or credential dependency.

## F. Risk Register
- Cross-tenant leakage: mitigated by ADR-0244 tenant scoping and Cedar default deny.
- Silent posting corruption: mitigated by idempotency, reversal events, reconciliation reports, and audit-chain evidence.
- Source-system mismatch: mitigated by dry-run import, checksums, and rejected-row queues.
- Jurisdictional non-compliance: mitigated by pack activation rules and compliance evidence exports.
- Operator overreach: mitigated by least privilege, break-glass evidence, and dual-control approval.

## G. Wave-3-G Follow-Up
Wave-3-G must add service-specific threat model, DPIA, Cedar files, auditor-scope policy, data-residency policy, CI-scope policy, runbooks, SLOs, dashboards, and scorecards.

## detection-substrate-binding
Warehouse binds detection to observability, audit-chain, policy, OpenBao, edge-WAF, and workflow-engine substrates. Every EWM bounded context emits signed audit events, metrics, traces, logs, and policy-decision evidence. Detection is compared against SAP EWM Extended Warehouse Management | Oracle Fusion Warehouse Management | Workday inventory-operations counterpart | NetSuite WMS | Microsoft Dynamics 365 Warehouse Management and is tenant-scoped before any operator sees it.

## insider-threat-controls
Insider controls require two-person approval for approve/reverse actions, segregation of duties between creator and approver, JIT OpenBao credentials with TTL no greater than 60 seconds, auditor read-only Cedar scopes, CI read-only scopes, and immutable evidence for every privileged action.

## threat-intelligence-feeds
Threat intelligence uses sanctioned-party, bot-score, credential-stuffing, exploit-CVE, supplier-risk, and jurisdiction-watch feeds. Feed decisions are advisory unless a Cedar policy explicitly permits enforcement. Emergency-services traffic bypasses visible challenge but not audit.

## key-rotation-cadence
Signing keys rotate every 90 days, ECH keys rotate every 90 days or faster after suspected exposure, OpenBao dynamic credentials expire within 60 seconds for provider credentials, and PQC certificate experiments are tracked without blocking classical fallback.

## crypto-agility-plan
Transport defaults to TLS 1.3 with HTTP/3, falls back to HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 in order, advertises ECH where terminated by the platform, and offers X25519MLKEM768 hybrid key agreement where peer support exists. The service never refuses a legitimate peer only because PQC or ECH is unavailable.

## critical-path-edge-cases
- emergency-services: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
- account-recovery-lockout: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
- financial-fraud-dispute-chargeback: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
- elder-financial-abuse: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
- healthcare-urgent-care-break-glass: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
- whistleblower-ethics-report: Warehouse documents bypass, recovery, dispute, or audit behavior with tenant scope, policy evidence, and no marketplace settlement ownership drift.
