# Architecture: Warehouse

## A. Boundary
This service owns control inbound/outbound warehouse processing, slotting, picking, packing, yard, labor, and goods movement evidence. It does not own adjacent ERP concerns, payment rails, tenant identity, policy engine, workflow runtime, or ontology storage.

## B. Layer Map
| ADR-0105 layer | Planned responsibility |
|---|---|
| api | public command/query DTOs and OpenAPI 3.2.0 contract binding |
| rest | HTTP transport and idempotency enforcement |
| application | orchestration of usecases and transactions |
| usecase | command handlers and read models |
| domain | business invariants and aggregate roots |
| kernel | pure value objects and deterministic calculations |
| adapter | source-system, database, and external-system adapters |
| worker | batch migration, reconciliation, and async workflow workers |
| governance | policy, compliance, scorecards, and evidence gates |

## C. Bounded Context Architecture
### inbound-delivery
- Aggregate root: inbound_delivery_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### outbound-delivery
- Aggregate root: outbound_delivery_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### putaway-task
- Aggregate root: putaway_task_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### picking-wave
- Aggregate root: picking_wave_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### yard-appointment
- Aggregate root: yard_appointment_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

### labor-assignment
- Aggregate root: labor_assignment_document.
- Invariants: tenant scope required, version monotonic, source-system provenance immutable, destructive correction forbidden.
- Commands: create, amend, approve, reverse, archive, import, export where applicable.
- Events: created, amended, approved, reversed, archived, import-accepted, import-rejected where applicable.
- Read model: tenant-scoped projection keyed by document id, status, period, region, and source-system id.

## D. Integration Topology

- marketplace: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- payments: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- production-planning: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- quality-management: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- global-trade: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.
- supply-chain-planning: interaction is API/event based with tenant context, trace context, idempotency key, and audit-chain reference.

## E. Failure Modes

- Source-system import drift: dry-run evidence identifies row, table, transform, and rejection reason.
- Cross-tenant reference attempt: Cedar denies before domain command execution and emits refusal evidence.
- Duplicate command submission: idempotency key returns previous result and increments duplicate metric.
- Regional outage: writes queue in the tenant home cell and reads expose stale-region metadata.
- Audit-chain outage: critical state transitions pause; non-critical queries continue with degraded banner.

## F. Data Integrity

Commands own local transactions. Cross-service work uses workflow-engine sagas and compensating transitions. Financial, inventory, trade, quality, and compliance documents reverse through explicit domain events rather than row deletion.

## G. Contracts

- REST: OpenAPI 3.2.0.
- Events: AsyncAPI 3.1.0.
- Internal RPC: proto3.
- Naming: BNF v4.1.
- Layers: ADR-0105 13-layer enum.

## H. Wave-3-G Follow-Up
The anchor architecture reserves the boundary. Wave-3-G adds contracts, Cedar policies, runbooks, SLOs, dashboards, catalog records, IaC, threat model, DPIA, capacity model, cost budget, failure modes, and implementation plans.
