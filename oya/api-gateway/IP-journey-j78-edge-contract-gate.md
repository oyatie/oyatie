# IP-journey-j78-edge-contract-gate - api-gateway

## Goal

Implement the `edge-contract-gate` slice for `api-gateway` so j78 can satisfy `EU-NIS2` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/api-gateway/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j78-eu-nis2-breach-three-stage-cadence/.
- Regulator article focus: NIS2 Art 21 cybersecurity risk-management.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/openapi/j78-edge-contract-gate-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/asyncapi/j78-edge-contract-gate-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/proto/j78-edge-contract-gate-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/api-gateway/policy/j78-edge-contract-gate.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/api-gateway/runbooks/j78-edge-contract-gate-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/api-gateway/tests/j78_edge_contract_gate_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `nis2-breach-cadence` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j78.api-gateway.edge-contract-gate", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "EU-NIS2" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "EU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J78ApiGatewayEdgeContractGateStarted`.
- `J78ApiGatewayEdgeContractGatePermitted`.
- `J78ApiGatewayEdgeContractGateDenied`.
- `J78ApiGatewayEdgeContractGateCommitted`.
- `J78ApiGatewayEdgeContractGateRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - api-gateway edge-contract-gate
Scope: implement one api-gateway behavior for j78, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: NIS2 Art 21 cybersecurity risk-management.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 17 service outage during regulator-deadline.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.

provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.

Regulator anchor: NIS2 Art 23 24h early warning.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 18 audit / regulator access.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

## Wave 15 counterpart anchor

GitHub and GitLab are the grep-recognized API-ingress counterparts for this preserved journey IP: the gateway work must keep route admission, webhooks, rate limits, TLS, canary routing, abuse defense, and emergency bypass controls explicit at the north-south edge.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)

- Carrier: public contract calls MUST carry `Oyatie-Version: 2026-05-21`, route external HTTP through `/v/2026-05-21/...`, and reserve proto3 field tag `8001` as the `oyatie_version` carrier on public protobuf envelopes.
- Initial declared_version: `microservices/api-gateway/manifest.json#api_versioning.declared_version` is absent in this checkout; declared_version is seeded as `2026-05-21`.
- Support window: `N=3` public date versions remain supported for at least `180` days after deprecation notice.
- Internal-mesh exemption: direct internal gRPC over HTTP/3 remains proto3 tag-compatible and is not version-routed at the mesh hop per ADR-0145.
- Surface evidence: `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/api-gateway.openapi.yaml`, `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/api-gateway.asyncapi.yaml`, `microservices/api-gateway/contracts/api_gateway.proto`, `microservices/api-gateway/IP-journey-j78-edge-contract-gate.md`.
