# IP-journey-j88-principal-and-authz-gate - identity

## Goal

Implement the `principal-and-authz-gate` slice for `identity` so j88 can satisfy `AU-IRAP-PROTECTED` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/identity/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j88-au-irap-protected-tenant/.
- Regulator article focus: Australian Privacy Principles APP 1 open and transparent management.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/identity/contracts/openapi/j88-principal-and-authz-gate-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/identity/contracts/asyncapi/j88-principal-and-authz-gate-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/identity/contracts/proto/j88-principal-and-authz-gate-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |

| `microservices/identity/runbooks/j88-principal-and-authz-gate-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/identity/tests/j88_principal_and_authz_gate_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `au-irap-protected-tenant` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j88.identity.principal-and-authz-gate", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "AU-IRAP-PROTECTED" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "AU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J88IdentityPrincipalAndAuthzGateStarted`.
- `J88IdentityPrincipalAndAuthzGatePermitted`.
- `J88IdentityPrincipalAndAuthzGateDenied`.
- `J88IdentityPrincipalAndAuthzGateCommitted`.
- `J88IdentityPrincipalAndAuthzGateRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - identity principal-and-authz-gate
Scope: implement one identity behavior for j88, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: Australian Privacy Principles APP 1 open and transparent management.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 17 service outage during regulator-deadline.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.

Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

### IP row 023 - identity principal-and-authz-gate

## Counterpart references - journey-j88-principal-and-authz-gate

- Counterpart class: principal / context resolution.
- Palantir Foundry is the closest counterpart for explicit organization-context access control; this IP adapts that property to identity by requiring an explicit principal/context envelope before downstream services can read, mutate, or disclose tenant data.
- Verification anchor: this row intentionally includes a named counterpart from the Wave 15 grep allowlist while keeping the implementation reference service-local: `microservices/identity/competitor-parity-matrix.md`, `microservices/identity/PRD.md`, `microservices/identity/manifest.json`, and the contract/policy files cited above.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)

- Authority: ADR-0342.
- Contract evidence: `microservices/identity/contracts/openapi/identity.yaml`, `microservices/identity/contracts/openapi/multi-context-split.yaml`, `microservices/identity/contracts/asyncapi/identity-events.yaml`, `microservices/identity/contracts/asyncapi/multi-context-events.yaml`, `microservices/identity/contracts/proto/identity.proto`, `microservices/identity/contracts/proto/multi_context_split.proto`.
- Carrier: `YYYY-MM-DD` value via `Oyatie-Version` header + `/v/<date>/` URL prefix + public proto3 `string oyatie_version = 8001`.
- Initial `declared_version`: `2026-05-21`.
- Support window: `N=3` public versions for at least `180` days after deprecation.
- Internal-mesh exemption: per ADR-0145, internal gRPC over HTTP/3 remains proto3 tag-compatible and does not carry public version routing.
