# IP-journey-j88-policy-and-attestation - governance

## Goal

Implement the `policy-and-attestation` slice for `governance` so j88 can satisfy `AU-IRAP-PROTECTED` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: microservices/governance/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j88-au-irap-protected-tenant/.
- Regulator article focus: Australian Privacy Principles APP 1 open and transparent management.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/governance/contracts/openapi/j88-policy-and-attestation-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/governance/contracts/asyncapi/j88-policy-and-attestation-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/governance/contracts/proto/j88-policy-and-attestation-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/governance/policy/j88-policy-and-attestation.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/governance/runbooks/j88-policy-and-attestation-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/governance/tests/j88_policy_and_attestation_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `au-irap-protected-tenant` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j88.governance.policy-and-attestation", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "AU-IRAP-PROTECTED" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "AU" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J88GovernancePolicyAndAttestationStarted`.
- `J88GovernancePolicyAndAttestationPermitted`.
- `J88GovernancePolicyAndAttestationDenied`.
- `J88GovernancePolicyAndAttestationCommitted`.
- `J88GovernancePolicyAndAttestationRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - governance policy-and-attestation
Scope: implement one governance behavior for j88, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: Australian Privacy Principles APP 1 open and transparent management.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 17 service outage during regulator-deadline.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.

provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.
Review: doc-style, privacy, security, and compliance reviewers can map this row to one implementation commit.

### IP row 023 - governance policy-and-attestation
Scope: implement one governance behavior for j88, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: APP 8 cross-border disclosure.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 22 disaster-zone surge.
Contract: AsyncAPI 3.1.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.

## Wave 15 counterpart verification note

This IP was preserved as already substantive; the Wave 15 scrub adds the explicit counterpart hook required by ADR-0328 D-20. Governance parity is evaluated against GitHub Advanced Security, SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, Open Policy Agent, Backstage TechDocs, and Renovate. The implementation must state which of those controls it closes or deliberately does not target before promotion.
