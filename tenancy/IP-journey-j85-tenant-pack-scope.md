# IP-journey-j85-tenant-pack-scope - tenancy

## Goal

Implement the `tenant-pack-scope` slice for `tenancy` so j85 can satisfy `HIPAA-2024` without leaking tenant data, collapsing provider-BYOK and encryption-BYOK meanings, or bypassing Cedar.

## PRD row alignment

- PRD anchor: tenancy/PRD.md when present, otherwise the service manifest and architecture surface for that microservice.
- Journey anchor: docs/user-journeys/j85-hipaa-end-to-end-phi-workflow/.
- Regulator article focus: HIPAA 45 CFR 164.504(e) business associate contract.
- Rigor row: documentation-rigor.md section 2 IP row; one service, one single-PR-sized implementation plan.

## Files to author in the implementation PR

| File | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `microservices/tenancy/contracts/openapi/j85-tenant-pack-scope-v1.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.2.0 REST surface | External read/write or admin action |
| `microservices/tenancy/contracts/asyncapi/j85-tenant-pack-scope-events-v1.yaml` | AsyncAPI 3.1.0 event surface | Emits ADR-0263 events |
| `microservices/tenancy/contracts/proto/j85-tenant-pack-scope-v1.proto` | proto3 internal RPC | Service-to-service call path |
| `microservices/tenancy/policy/j85-tenant-pack-scope.cedar` | Cedar permit/forbid bundle | Deny-wins gate |
| `microservices/tenancy/runbooks/j85-tenant-pack-scope-rollback.md` | Rollback and incident path | Includes regulator deadline handling |
| `microservices/tenancy/tests/j85_tenant_pack_scope_test.rs` | Integration tests | Positive, negative, rollback, audit |

## Data model

Primary object: `hipaa-phi-workflow` with tenant_id, subject_id, pack_id, jurisdiction_code, purpose, data_class, deadline_at, byok_provider_ref, byok_encryption_ref, and prior_seal_ref.
The service may store a local projection only when it can be rebuilt from the audit-chain and source-of-truth service. Mutable state must carry tenant_id and data_class.

## Cedar fragment

```cedar
permit (principal is Principal, action == Action::"j85.tenancy.tenant-pack-scope", resource is JourneyObject) when {
  principal.tenant_id == resource.tenant_id &&
  resource.pack_overlay == "HIPAA-2024" &&
  context.jurisdiction == "US" &&
  context.data_class_allowed == true &&
  context.audit_chain_required == true
};
```

## Audit event classes

- `J85TenancyTenantPackScopeStarted`.
- `J85TenancyTenantPackScopePermitted`.
- `J85TenancyTenantPackScopeDenied`.
- `J85TenancyTenantPackScopeCommitted`.
- `J85TenancyTenantPackScopeRolledBack`.

## Implementation rows

### IP row 001 - tenancy tenant-pack-scope

### IP row 022 - tenancy tenant-pack-scope
Scope: implement one tenancy behavior for j85, not a cross-service refactor.
Regulator anchor: HIPAA 45 CFR 164.312(a)(2)(ii) emergency access.
Critical path: documentation-rigor.md section 3.2.5 row 12 disability accommodations.
Contract: OpenAPI 3.2.0 envelope includes tenant_id, pack_id, data_class, purpose, deadline_at, and prior_seal_ref.
Authorization: Cedar evaluates in-process with deny-wins semantics and signed fragment bundle provenance.
State: local writes are idempotent by journey_id plus service_step_id; duplicate requests return the prior result.
provider-BYOK: external provider credential handles stay in the provider sidecar and never masquerade as encryption keys.
encryption-BYOK: cryptographic key references stay in cloud-secrets and rotate without changing provider routing.
Observability: emit latency histogram, denial counter, retry counter, deadline slack gauge, and audit seal latency.
Failure mode: downstream unavailable causes pause and retry, not partial completion or silent success.
Rollback: reverse only local pending mutation and append a rollback event that cites the original seal.
Tests: positive permit, denial on wrong tenant, denial on stale pack, duplicate idempotency, rollback after injected failure, and schema validation.

## API Versioning (per ADR-0342)
- Carrier: public boundary uses `Oyatie-Version: 2026-05-21`, URL prefix `/v/2026-05-21/`, and proto3 field tag `8001` for `oyatie_version`.
- `declared_version`: `2026-05-21`; support window is `N=3` public date versions for at least `180` days after deprecation.
- Internal-mesh exemption: internal gRPC remains on mesh proto3 compatibility and does not require the public URL/header carrier.
- Surface evidence: `tenancy/IP-journey-j85-tenant-pack-scope.md` matched `openapi, asyncapi, .proto`; contract files `tenancy/contracts/openapi/tenancy.yaml, tenancy/contracts/asyncapi/tenant-events.yaml, tenancy/contracts/proto/tenancy.proto`; type anchor `crates/oya-tenancy-api/src/lib.rs::TenantCreateApiRequest`.
