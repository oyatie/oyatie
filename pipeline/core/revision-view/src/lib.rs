//! Identity binding for a derived view of one immutable revision.
//!
//! A view is never tracked. What makes it trustworthy is that it names the
//! revision it was derived from and every input digest it consumed, so a
//! consumer can prove the view it holds and the tree it is about are the same
//! thing. This crate owns that binding and nothing else: no I/O, no
//! materialization, no digest computation.
//!
//! The revision is checked to be an object name. Digests are **opaque**: the
//! caller supplies them, and this refuses a blank one — as it refuses a blank
//! name — but cannot tell a real digest from any other string. A view
//! therefore proves which revision and which input NAMES it covers, and
//! carries the caller's word for the rest.
